In addition, advances in the manufacturing of IC chips has led to significant decreases in the power supply voltages which are used to power circuitry on the chips. It is also common to reduce the power supply voltage used in IC chips used in hand-held electronic devices, such as cellular phones and pagers, where power consumption and battery life are especially important characteristics. The smaller chips often reduce the available space on a printed circuit board used to carry the IC chips, or increase the size of the battery within the device.\nFIG. 1 is a schematic circuit diagram of an IC chip 1 including a memory circuit 100. The memory circuit includes a memory array 102 including a number of memory cells in which data can be stored. An input/output (I/O) circuit 104 is coupled to the array 102, and is operable to store data from the array 102 to an exterior device or to externally output data stored in the array 104 to the exterior device. A control circuit 106 is included, and is operable for reading data from and writing data to the array 102. A signal generator 108 generates and provides one or more control signals which are used in the control circuit 106 to access the memory cells in the array 102. The control circuit 106 includes control decoder 110 coupled between the signal generator 108 and the I/O circuit 104. In the control decoder 110, a first set of decoder elements are coupled to a first set of external bits in the array 102, and a second set of decoder elements are coupled to a second set of external bits in the array 102. The configuration of the decoder elements can be selected by one or more control signals provided by the signal generator 108.\nThe memory circuits are typically designed to operate properly with power supply voltages at a minimum of 5 volts. However, power supply voltages at 3.3 volts, 2.5 volts, 1.8 volts, are common in today\"\"s personal computers and other electronic devices, as explained above. As a result, circuits within IC chips often operate within much lower power supply voltage ranges than those of the circuits in the memory circuit 100. Because of the mismatch in operating voltages, memory circuits often are not designed to operate efficiently on less than the full power supply available on the chip.

One such known system is commonly referred to as a lacing system, but it should be understood that the term lacing system should not be construed in a narrow or restrictive sense. The invention described herein represents an improvement to such a lacing system.\nA typical known lacing system comprises a loop engaging member mounted on the second article and a loop receiving member mounted on the first article, the two loop engaging and receiving members being releasably connected such that the first article can be connected to the second article via a loop formed through the loop receiving member and loop engaging member. The loop forming and receiving members are generally made as a single element (so as to facilitate manufacture) comprising two halves, and are typically made of metal material.\nThe connection between the two halves is typically provided by a single row of individual elements or teeth, each connected to a metal link in the loop receiving member and to a corresponding metal link in the loop receiving member, and the two halves are generally connected by a connector element between the metal links. Such laces are particularly suitable for shoes and/or boots, although many other articles can optionally be connected using the same type of laces.\nConventionally, the metal links provide the mechanical connection with the two halves, but it is also known for one or both of the halves to be at least partially plastic, for example the loop receiving member might be partially plastics, being formed by injection moulding, with the metal links (and teeth) simply being formed integrally therewith.\nAlthough such a system works well for connecting the two halves of an article, and hence for forming a loop or loop-like portion which extends around the article or shoe/boot, there remains a need to improve the comfort and/or appearance of such shoes. For example in sport shoes, there is a desire to provide a more attractive appearance, and if a pair of shoes are to be stored in a sports bag for the duration of a sporting event, it is desirable to minimise their length in order to reduce the risk of damage to them.\nFurthermore, such conventional laces have a number of points of contact with the shoe, and these points of contact with the shoe can sometimes become frayed and may even become", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Technical Field\nThe present invention generally relates to an improved data processing system and in particular to a method and system for processing data stored in multiple caches. Still more particularly, the present invention relates to a method and system for performing a cache coalescing operation when multiple data sets corresponding to a single data object are stored in respective caches.\n2. Description of Related Art\nIn a data processing system, data stored in an external database (e.g., the operating system) is provided to program memory through a memory controller. This data is transferred from the memory controller to the main system memory for eventual use by a processor in the system. Data is transferred from a cache of the main system memory to the processor for execution. The transfer of data from the main memory system may include read operations or writes. A memory controller and a cache memory controller may each include multiple buffers that may be shared among various modules within the data processing system. Caches are included in the design to prevent storage of repeated data elements and provide faster access to the main memory.\nIn a typical architecture, main system memory may contain a main memory line and multiple data sets (e.g., cache lines) corresponding to the same data item. In some cases, more than one copy of the data set could be cached in the cache memory for the program image memory. These data sets are cached using various cache memory strategies such as least recently used (LRU) and least recently used copy (LRU-Copies). Depending on the cache allocation algorithm in use, the cache line having a copy of the data set updated most recently is more likely to be chosen for removal from the cache when there is a cache miss in the cache. These cache allocation strategies are implemented to reduce memory usage caused by frequently used data or to achieve improved cache performance.\nOne data allocation strategy to reduce memory usage may be referred to as a cache coherence strategy. In some cache coherence strategies, a state machine is used by hardware to keep track, by some logic or mechanism, of which data sets (e.g., cache lines) are in-core copies of the same data set. Some cache coherence algorithms use a distributed lock to implement these in-core copies or caches of a data item. In such instances, the caches are synchronized. For a given data set, the state machine in control of the cache allocation must ensure that the data set (e.g., the cache line) in control is not accessed for a time period before the data set is released.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Although the ladder has been shown to be effective in promoting interprofessional practice and education, it has been previously published with only moderate construct validity studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate construct validity and the usability of the ladder using a simulation approach. In October 2016, we used an experimental design to demonstrate the ladder in a real clinical setting to 24 student nurses working in a patient pain unit. All the participants were exposed to the ladder in the same clinical setting following all steps sequentially, each for 45 minutes. For each step, a checklist was administered in order to evaluate the participants' evaluation of the ladder and their perception of it as useful to prepare them to practice pain management with a diverse group of healthcare professionals in their future work place. Finally, the participants were debriefed by using a post-test questionnaire. Data were analyzed using univariate and bivariate inferential analyses. In addition, a qualitative study approach (content analysis) was also used to examine the participants' perception of the ladder. Of the 24 students, 100% reported a positive experience using this educational ladder while 96.6% believed the ladder would be \"useful to prepare them for interprofessional practice.\" The ladder was also appreciated by all the participants for its positive learning experience. The qualitative study identified 4 themes (acceptability, comprehensibility, credibility, and usefulness), in addition to 2 subthemes (previous experience and learning) and 1 example for each of them. The students appreciated the educational ladder, believing that it was valuable in providing relevant knowledge and preparing them for interprofessional practice.

The subjects were 14 patients with AOLE and 19 patients with PTA applied to the lower extremities. Both arterial wall of the occlusion and distal end were studied pathologically. The cause of occlusion lesion in the former group were thrombosis in 8 cases and atherosclerotic lesion with atheromatous protrusion in 6 cases. The lesions of the latter group were neointimal hyperplasia in 4 cases and atheromatous thickening of the vessel wall in 15 cases. Our findings showed that the causes of AOLE were thrombosis in many cases and vascular intimal hyperplasia was present in the lesions of AOLE which had been subjected to PTA. In regard of pathogenesis with this point of view, we studied the relation between vascular intimal hyperplasia and the duration of angioplasty. Our results showed that vascular intimal hyperplasia was found up to one year after angioplasty and was rarely found thereafter. We also studied clinical and pathologic aspects of AOLE after PTA. The lesion in the former group had thrombotic occlusion and the lesion of the latter group had neointimal hyperplasia.

Thoughts?\n\nA:\n\nIt sounds like you may want to do this yourself. I don't think that there are any particularly good tools. That said, you can automate the most difficult part of the task.\nStep 1: \nPick your text editor. I use vim so I'll provide my steps for that. So you copy the image you want to clean out and paste it into a temporary directory. For instance, I paste mine at $HOME/temp. I then make the next three steps, replacing $HOME with whatever directory you choose for your working directory.\ncat $HOME/temp/image.jpg | grep -oP '<img([^>]*)>' > img-template.txt\nvim img-template.txt\n\nFor the next step, you need your text editor to save a backup copy of the file you want to keep. You can do this easily with the next command.\nrm -f $HOME/temp/image.jpg\n\nStep 2: \nNow your editor can copy the image file and replace the <img> elements with its own. You can do this with sed to substitute your template file as directed in the sed manual.\ncat img-template.txt | \\\n    sed -f - $HOME/temp/image-clean.sed \\\n    $home/temp/image.jpg > $HOME/temp/image-clean.txt\n\nFor your final step, you want to copy back the cleaned version of the image to the original directory. Once again, you can do this easily with the last script. I use cp, and then you might want to do something like this to verify the result.\ncp $HOME/temp/image-clean.txt $HOME/temp/original-image.txt\n\nStep 3: \nThis is the point where we automate everything.

Ishikawa et al., IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, Vol. 45, No. 2, February 1998, pp. 282-287, proposes using silicon-germanium layers, mixed with layers of other materials, on a substrate by doping with boron at the interface between the silicon and the silicon-germanium layer, and then oxidizing the silicon—germanium layer.\nThe article “Polymorphism at the Bistable/Mesostable Transition” by S. P. Murarka, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 89 (2002) 157202, shows that there is a critical thickness for such a bistable/mesostable transition on the silicon/silicon-germanium interface.\nGerman patent DE 39 12 069 describes a method of producing, starting from a silicon substrate, a layer made of epitaxial silicon on which a silicon-germanium layer with a SiGe ratio of 0.5 to 1% is subsequently deposited. German patent DE 39 12 070 describes a similar method with a silicon-germanium layer with a ratio SiGe of 0.1% to 1.3% in which at least one of the two silicon layers with germanium is a mixed layer (comprising silicon-germanium mixed in the silicon). These mixed layers are described as having a thickness of more than 10 nm. A method of etching away silicon-germanium in the mixed layer to produce a base layer comprising silicon-germanium with a ratio from 0.1% to 0.5% is neither described in this document.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

We investigated whether bevacizumab added to gemcitabine and carboplatin improves clinical outcomes in recurrent and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC). Eligible patients (n = 22) had not received a prior anti-vascular tumor agent; only 1 had received bevacizumab. Median age was 59 years; 62% had stage IV disease and 74% had human papillomavirus-associated cancer. Patients received 6 cycles of carboplatin 1.4 mg/kg at area under the curve day 1 and gemcitabine 750 mg/m2 on days 8 and 15, with carboplatin/gemcitabine weekly for no more than 6 cycles. Bevacizumab was administered at 5 mg/kg with the first dose of gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by maintenance bevacizumab at 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks for 6 more cycles.

The short answer: I don't think \"why would they go there in the first place?\" would make any sort of reasonable sense to them. For those who haven't heard of Doctor Who, it's about a time traveller from a far future who travels through time to help an assortment of ancient beings who are threatened by an extraterrestrial war machine. There are more questions than answers surrounding their identities and motivations. It's hard to say where their origins, motivations or intentions lie.\n\nThe concept of an ancient alien civilization defending some other race against an aggressive extraterrestrial force has been around a long time. The story was pioneered on radio and television by Orson Welles in The War of the Worlds story on November 2, 1938. In 1942, the story was adapted for cinema by George Pal, the same man who adapted The Time Machine and It's a Wonderful Life into film. The movie was a flop. To this day, it's among the few of the Orson Welles' radio plays that people are probably familiar with, at least by name.\n\nSince most of the history of alien encounters comes out of the pages of science fiction rather than from any factual evidence, this question of ancient aliens could be considered to be an open topic. To date, there have been very few credible theories about alien contact. The most recent example is the 2013 discovery of a massive stone statue in Mexico that may predate human history by several thousand years, which has sparked theories that it may have been created by an extraterrestrial civilization. Unfortunately, the case remains unproven.\n\nOne of the clearest explanations for ancient alien contact comes from the Mayan astronomer and writer Edward Herbert, who wrote the book The Secret of the Gods in 1954. Herbert wrote: \"We know now that the ancient peoples had many sources of strange knowledge and that the stars were a part of these mysteries. We know that they were familiar with life throughout the universe. These they regarded as gods; this concept has been confirmed in many studies.

Description of the Related Art\nWith the advancement in information-oriented societies, demand for flat panel display devices having advantages of reduced volume, portability and lower power consumption, to achieve high definition and high color-generation, has increased. Typical flat panel display devices, such as liquid crystal displays (LCDs), plasma display panels (PDPs), and organic electro luminescence displays (OLEDs), include an electrical/optical device disposed inside a panel, and an external driving circuit for applying electric power to the electrical/optical device.\nIn order to realize high resolution as a result of the increased number of pixels per unit area (referred to as the ‘pixel pitch’) of the display device, the number of connection lines and the number of thin film transistors (TFTs) that are formed in the driving circuit must also be increased. In a process of fabricating the display panel and the driving circuit, a process of making microcontact holes in an insulation film is included.\nConventionally, in a process of making microcontact holes, a plurality of holes is formed continuously. However, as a result of the continuously arranged holes, an area corresponding to a single pixel is occupied by several holes, and accordingly, the area for one circuit (e.g., one driving circuit) becomes narrow.\nFor example, in a process of making a display which adopts an active matrix driving method, a TFT is disposed in correspondence with each sub-pixel having a thin film that is a color filter and a light emitting element. However, as a result of the manufacturing processes, a single TFT circuit may include several sub-pixels. A first contact hole is used to connect the TFT with each sub-pixel, and a second contact hole is used to connect each of the sub-pixels with an external electrical circuit. Since the contact holes are arranged so as to correspond to the sub-pixels, the sub-pixels are separated from each other by portions that are not contact holes, and correspondingly, the area for the TFT circuit becomes narrow.\nFurthermore, as a result of a single TFT circuit occupying", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

All publications cited in this application are herein incorporated by reference.\nThere are numerous steps in the development of any novel, desirable plant germplasm. Plant breeding begins with the analysis and definition of problems and weaknesses of the current germplasm, the establishment of program goals, and the definition of specific breeding objectives. The next step is selection of germplasm that possesses the traits to meet the program goals. The goal is to combine in a single cultivar an improved combination of desirable traits from the parental germplasm. These important traits may include, but are not limited to, higher seed yield, resistance to diseases and insects, better stems and roots, tolerance to drought and heat, altered fatty acid profile, abiotic stress tolerance, improvements in compositional traits, and better agronomic quality.\nThese processes, which lead to the final step of marketing and distribution, can take from six to twelve years from the time the first cross is made. Therefore, development of new cultivars is a time-consuming process that requires precise forward planning, efficient use of resources, and a minimum of changes in direction.\nSoybean (Glycine max), is an important and valuable field crop. Thus, a continuing goal of soybean plant breeding is to develop stable, high yielding soybean cultivars that are agronomically sound. The reasons for this goal are to maximize the amount of grain produced on the land used and to supply food for both animals and humans. To accomplish this goal, the soybean breeder must select and develop soybean plants that have the traits that result in superior varieties.\nThe soybean is the world's leading source of vegetable oil and protein meal. The oil extracted from soybeans is used for cooking oil, margarine, and salad dressings. Soybean oil is composed of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. It has a typical composition of 11% palmitic, 4% stearic, 25% oleic, 50% linoleic, and 9% linolenic fatty acid content (“Economic Implications of Modified Soybean Traits Summary Report,” Iowa Soybean Promotion Board and American Soybean Association Special Report 92S (May 1990)).

However, there is a problem in that the leakage of fuel occurs in the interior of the fuel injection valves, due to the pressure of the fuel in the fuel supply passage being a negative pressure.\nIn the case of a fuel injection valve in which a pressure of supply fuel is higher than a predetermined pressure, there is also a problem in that a large amount of a leakage gas enters the interior of the fuel injection valve through the fuel supply passage, depending on the negative pressure in the fuel supply passage, thus making precise control of the injection amount of the fuel difficult to achieve.\nIt is necessary to reduce the leakage of fuel in order to precisely control the injection amount of the fuel.\nThe present invention has been achieved with the object of providing a fuel injection apparatus that enables precise control of fuel injection amounts even when a negative pressure is generated in a fuel passage located in the interior of a fuel injection valve, and also enables more secure prevention of leakage of fuel from the interior of the fuel injection valve.\nAn apparatus according to the present invention comprises first and second solenoid actuated valves, a multi-injection valve, a throttle valve and a pressure reducing valve, wherein the first and second solenoid actuated valves are each operated by an electric current applied by a solenoid unit to open and close, and the multi-injection valve is controlled by the operation of the actuated valves. The fuel supply passage from which the fuel is supplied to the multi-injection valve has a throttle valve inserted therein. The throttle valve is provided such that the pressure in the passage is reduced by a predetermined pressure or less when no flow of fuel passes.\nMore specifically, in the apparatus of the present invention, the fuel supply passage is provided such that when no flow of fuel passes, the pressure in the fuel supply passage is reduced by a predetermined pressure or less. The throttle valve is inserted in the fuel supply passage. Accordingly, when such an operation is performed, a negative pressure is generated in the", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

I’m pretty sure I’ve discussed this before, but, since being a writer, and my work, is an exercise in constantly writing and rewriting, it’s important for me to make sure I have enough to do with my time. I’m a firm believer that time can be wasted easily and that if we are constantly trying to figure out ways to waste time we should probably rethink our priorities.\n\nSo, I’m fairly self-evidently busy—I have a book I have to write, my blog is updated regularly, and I’ve been a bit of a maniac this year with trying to get my shit together and stay organized, to some effect, to my benefit. It’s very difficult to maintain my own personal schedule and sometimes, in the throes of my own chaos, things become quite disjointed and I find myself in a rut.\n\nSo, I was doing my workout routine and having a pretty solid day. I was at the gym for a good chunk of the day and it was only in the latter stages of the day when I began feeling a little “off” so I thought, “Great! I should get down on the treadmill and do a bit of stretching before I end.”\n\nI should mention that these past couple of months, I have been focusing very specifically on my core muscles. That means, if you’re familiar with how all bodybuilders work, that I’ve been doing planks and chins, but now I have a core-specific exercise routine, where I am doing side planks, weighted planks, lunges and push ups. One of the many wonderful things about core training is that I can do it when I’m traveling, because no one’s going to care that I’m sitting down with my laptop in front of me.\n\nSo, with all the core training, including the workout I was just doing, it didn’t occur to me to do a specific plank routine to help keep my core muscles exercised. I just figured, as I always have, that I’ll just get off the treadmill and stretch a bit before I go to shower.

Covered rolls are conventionally wound by driving a covering web, for example plastic coated paper, onto the cylindrical material roll, and the cover web is preferably held fixed by one or more suction devices.\nFor cutting the ends of such rolls there have to date been devices in which the material roll is cut by an adjustable cutting knife or other cutting means while at the same time a cutting plate is used to tear off the cover web. The cutting plate is conventionally secured to a support beam by means of at least one bolt. During the operation the support beam is fixed in its position on the cutting means, while at the same time rotating the material roll.\nIn such a solution however, the cutting plate has to be loosened from the support beam by means of a screwing action, in order to be able to place the cutting device against the material roll.\nAs noted above the cutting plate is pressed against the material roll, and in order to prevent undesired lateral movements and vibrations of the cutting plate it is held in place by screws. As a result there are a plurality of separate components that may cause problems during the operation, e.g. the tightening of the bolts or that of the screws, and the fact that each component has to be handled as it is loosened from its position. This makes the work cumbersome and awkward as well as complicated.\nIt is desirable to simplify the adjustment procedures of the cutting plate by using one common support beam so as to reduce the complexity of adjusting the cutting plate and to avoid the risk of screwing and unscrewing the screws of the cutting plate. It is also desirable to simplify the operation of the machine in order to reduce the number of handling procedures.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Description of the Related Art\nFor a variety of reasons, consumers are beginning to purchase more digital images than they have in the past. Specifically, consumer usage of digital cameras and the Internet have increased steadily over the last few years. In fact, today, many consumers now own one or more digital cameras, cellular phones having cameras, and other portable computing devices. For many consumers, obtaining digital photos has thus become the norm and may be more common than purchasing film.\nDue to the widespread acceptance and use of digital imaging products, there has been increasing interest in using digital imaging devices to obtain images of high quality. Consumers typically expect high quality byproducts. For example, consumers may demand images of high resolution (i.e., with more pixels), high fidelity, high gloss and/or color stability over time (e.g., fading and the like), and such like.\nThere are, however, several factors that may cause degradation in a print job. For example, the images in a print job may be of a low resolution, the colors in the images may be of a low color fidelity, and/or the images in the print job may have a low gloss or quality. Such factors may generally occur for a variety of reasons, such as the use of poor quality image input devices or the inclusion of unwanted items in the print job.\nThus, there is a need for a system and method to detect/prevent degradation in an image in a print job generated by an output device.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Such services, which are provided to compensate for the need to use the tooth, usually require that new tooth material be placed in place to compensate for the loss of tooth substance. In contrast, dentists may find a person to be in need of dental services for preventive reasons, to correct what appears to be some condition of tooth structure itself. Preventive services often involve removing decayed tooth structure. Once decay is present, it may be more appropriate to attempt to save the tooth and restore its function, i.e. by placing material in place to retain the tooth's function.\nCaring for and correcting teeth includes two distinct groups of procedures that have traditionally been undertaken by two distinctly separate practitioners: dentists and oral surgeons. This dichotomy between dentists and oral surgeons is unfortunate, especially today as both are performing many of the same procedures. Moreover, this dichotomy is not a recent phenomenon as a similar dichotomy existed several centuries in the past. It is well known to physicians, dentists, oral surgeons and other health care professionals who perform surgery, that a practitioner who specializes in performing a procedure may sometimes achieve a better result, than a practitioner lacking skill or experience in that procedure.\nConventional wisdom has suggested that orthodontists should perform all procedures related to treating tooth structure. As described by Dr. Arthur F. Lawrence, in a publication entitled, \"The Complete Orthodontist's Guide, Volume II, Procedures and Materials Related to Tooth Structure\" (1979), orthodontists are able to better care for patients' tooth structure through their special knowledge and clinical expertise. However, it is common to find that orthodontists are unable to perform restorative procedures, such as fillings and orthodontic adjustments or other procedures which require a general dental practitioner's skills.\nIn Dr. Lawrence's view, only orthodontists can perform an orthodontic reduction of tooth size, remove and replace a decayed area, and perform a root canal procedure. In most of the United States, general dentists perform root canals and may perform fillings and other procedures associated with tooth structure.

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to an image information reading control device, a reading control program and an image information reading apparatus. More particularly, the present invention relates to a technique to prevent a user from operating the apparatus, a technique to improve operability at the time of image reading, and a technique to provide a user-friendly electronic document management system.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nRecently, there is a rapid increase in the number of electronic documents including documents that are created by using word processors, personal computers, facsimile equipment, network equipment and the like. Under these circumstances, electronic documents, including documents that are created by using these devices, have to be saved or managed to keep them safe, and users have to search for target documents among a large amount of accumulated documents.\nIn the case of searching for a target paper document, the user has to find a document file having a desired content using a database system provided on an image information reading apparatus, such as a scanner or a multi-function printer. In this case, the user has to perform an operation of opening the document file and reading contents of the document. This operation is rather complicated in operation.\nTo solve this problem, image information processing apparatuses have been developed in which image information, including documents containing various written information such as characters, is read with use of an image information reading apparatus including an electronic document management device. For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2000-075972 has disclosed an image information processing apparatus capable of reading handwritten notes together with printed ones. In this image information processing apparatus, the handwritten notes are read in an appropriate language. After that, the handwritten notes are synthesized with the printed ones, and then output. With this system, the handwritten notes can be provided on a paper document in an appropriate language without having to read the written documents in pages.\nIn the document management system including the image information processing apparatus as described above, an electronic file is associated with each paper document. In this case, there may be an issue of copyright on a text. In some cases, the document itself may be written or printed with a copyright symbol. If the conventional image information reading system is employed to read and process the paper document, including a document that has been created by copying and inserting the electronic document associated with the paper document, the copyright symbol (COPYRIGHT) may be detected as a text in the original text. Thus, the text containing the copyright symbol becomes", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Here are a few things I’ve found to be very helpful tools:\n\nDon’t sweat it when you make “mistakes.” Instead, recognize that it’s probably human to make mistakes from time to time. The mistake is not in the mistake you make, but in the fact that they exist at all. What’s not human is making mistakes over and over again. (In D&D, this is a fairly reliable sign of a player playing an intentionally artificial character. Players shouldn’t tend to make bad rolls this often or be so stubborn in their mistakes for a DM who has clearly made an effort to anticipate most of these kinds of things.)\n\nDon’t bother with “fixing the mistake.” The first step in this kind of problem is realizing that mistakes are inevitable; the next step is trying to eliminate all the mistakes. If they insist on a particularly poor idea or if they’re unhappy with the result, that’s fine, but don’t waste effort fixing what’s already been fixed.\n\nDon’t be afraid of players who say, “But I thought he would have x!” The phrase is “But I thought He” which implies that it’s a mistake I made, which means it’s likely not mine and not something that I did intentionally. I don’t take it personally if I didn’t expect that particular event.

In addition, the response to hepatitis B vaccination was tested over a follow-up period of 12 months. The prevalence of HBsAg at entry to hemodialysis treatment was 8.9 +/- 0.2% (mean +/- SE). There was no significant correlation between patients younger than 30 years of age and the prevalence of HBsAg. In contrast, age was significantly correlated with the prevalence of HIV antibodies. In general, older patients had a lower prevalence of HBsAg and HIV antibodies than did younger patients. During the follow-up period, the incidence of HBsAg seroclearance and seroconversion was 0.27 and 0.22%, respectively. No significant correlation was found between the presence of HBsAg and the development of HBRI. HBV vaccination was administered to 628 patients in a single dose at initiation of treatment. After 10 and 12 months a follow-up questionnaire was administered to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccines. The immune response was seroprotective in 907 of 918 (98.9%) patients. We conclude that the prevalence of serologic markers of HBV infection in our cohort is less than that reported for patients during dialysis therapy before the introduction of nucleoside analogs to treat hepatitis B. No evidence of hepatitis B replication was found. HBV vaccination in hemodialysis patients was well accepted, and protection against HBV infection was elicited in the majority of patients.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

This phase II study evaluated 41 patients who were treated with the four-drug regimen of cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2), BCNU (50 mg/m2), melphalan (30 mg/m2), and vincristine (1.4 mg/m2) followed by fludarabine (30 mg/m2) and amifostine (3000 mg/m2). Hematologic toxicity was well tolerated and included myelosuppression in 32 patients (78%), diarrhea in 18 (44%). Thrombocytopenia was > or = grade 6 in only two patients. No thrombohemorrhagic complications were reported. Twenty-three patients responded (79%) for a complete response and 11 (41%) for a very good partial response (VGPR). The survival rate was 45% (three-year survival rate) and 36% (median survival time). A Cox regression analysis identified three pretreatment characteristics as significant prognostic factors: serum creatinine level, performance status, and time from initial diagnosis to therapy. These three covariates were included in the multivariate analysis for the prediction of survival. Overall survival was best in patients pretreated with vincristine-containing regimens. The survival rate was 44% in those pretreated with both vincristine and cyclophosphamide, compared with 16% in the other patients; the corresponding time intervals for survival were 13.2 versus 22.9 months (P =.018). Overall survival was also favorable in patients with a renal clearance of > or = 30 mL/min compared with < 30 mL/min (P =.044). Patients pretreated with the four-drug regimen showed a superior response rate, a significantly longer time to progression (median time: 11.5 months), and a significantly longer survival (median: 25.6 months) than did the patients who were not pretreated with this intensified regimen.

The thing remains one of the main subjects of Americans’ conversations in the house, with health insurance being of such a heavy burden that the way in which it works is one of the very frequent topics discussed within the house.\n\nWhen it comes to insurance, lots of people don’t have a way to get health insurance for their own needs. They work within the house with low pay, and often don’t have a way to help their insurance or get it through their job. In addition to that, insurance can be expensive for a reason or another. A considerable number of insurance programs can be very expensive considering and a large quantity of insurance for insurance can be pricey. The following are some of the many tips that you can use to create an insurance plan for you and your family, while not breaking the bank.\n\nIt can be very smart to begin with the small insurance coverage things. The beginning is the place the interest will begin. It’s best to consider your insurance plan first and choose something that you are able to pay for. Insurance is something that will need to be paid back, so if you are having financial pressure, you will probably need to spend more than the minimal possible monthly payment. In the end, you will know precisely what your financial predicament is and will be able to make a decision that is most beneficial for your funds. In the event that you are going to take out coverage for yourself or your children, don’t decide for insurance policies that just cover basic things. It will be very important to decide on insurance plan that can cover healthcare.\n\nWhen discussing health insurance, you have to make sure that you talk with experts who are experienced in the current medical world. In the end, you’ll want to make sure that the insurance coverage that you select for yourself is suitable for what you require.

Prospective observational study. Medical teaching hospital. Fourteen septic patients with acute lung injury/acute lung injury syndrome (ARDS) were mechanically ventilated, and a continuous infusion of remifentanil was used to maintain anesthesia. Microvascular blood flow was measured noninvasively, and arterial and lung capillary pressure were measured invasively. Lung injury was assessed at 2.5-7.25 hrs of MV by bronchoalveolar lavage and measurements of lung mechanics, diffusing capacity, and microvascular blood flow. Lung injury was present in 5 of 6 patients who received high oxygen concentrations and in 7 of 8 patients who received lower oxygen concentrations (p = 0.04). Increased capillary pressure was present in the patients who received high PEEP levels (p = 0.01). The highest lung injury scores were associated with the presence of arterial oxygen saturation, PaO2/FIO2 ratio, lung compliance, PEEP, lung volume recruitment, and ventilation with low inspiratory pressure (p < 0.05). Microvascular blood flow decreased in patients who tolerated MV at high oxygen concentrations, and a lung injury score > or = 5 was associated with higher capillary pressures (p = 0.004). However, microvascular blood flow significantly increased in patients who had increased lung injury scores at ventilation with low inspiratory pressure (p = 0.002).

More particularly, it relates to a hand-operated device for measuring the amount of salt, sand and other impurities in the water of a vehicle's cooling system, as well as the amount of deposit materials which collect in water-carrier conduits and components to which water is exposed.\nIn a vehicle the cooling system of its engine is dependent upon a source of heat-dissipating water such as an engine's radiator which requires considerable water to operate properly.\nThe amount of water required for the vehicle's cooling system depends greatly upon the amount and characteristics of the water in its \"coolant\" supplied to the automobile engine. If the coolant water is impure, either in chemical or mineral composition, the engine will not operate efficiently either cold-starting or in warm weather.\nConventional cooling systems circulate either fresh or antifreeze coolant continuously through passages in which the engine's cylinder heads and other engine components are mounted on a base to take on, and dissipate, heat from the engine's cylinder heads, and to remove the heat generated during engine operation. The water in the cooling system flows through hoses or lines which carry the heated coolant to the radiator for heat-exchange and to the engine \"water jackets\" for dissipation of the heat of conduction through the engine block, head, and pistons carried by the engine's crank-pin to the coolant water in the cylinders.\nSince engines have been built to operate for years, and have accumulated a great deal of corrosion and deposit material from engine use, the normal coolant water becomes mired with impurity, especially when operated in the hot summers or heated engine rooms of vehicles.\nThe amount of deposit material in the coolant can vary greatly.

This is the description. Here is a link to read the book online. This is an excerpt and I will link the full post at the bottom of this entry. Read the post here. From: David Gidley\n\nIn the year 2200, the world you know today will be utterly unrecognisable. The air will be clean and free of pollution. The seas will support a full ecosystem of ocean life. There will be a complete interdependence of people and planet, of all living things, to ensure mankind’s survival. This is the world we are now embarking upon as technological, medical and human development unfolds, providing us with ever brighter futures for ourselves and our children. At the same time, a darker world of dangers and dangers awaits those who allow their planet and their fellow people to be stripped away by those who would lead the way to a world of their making. We have long been aware of this danger.\n\nOur history tells us that this is a perilous path to walk, and yet we persevere. In the last century much has been learned in our efforts across the planet to achieve a clean and stable planet, and to provide for all its inhabitants. Through our collective action and hard-working dedication, we have built a world in which not only can we live, but should we choose to, we too can thrive as a society.\n\nTo those who believe that we have not achieved all we need to build a world of our dreams and ambitions, to those who believe that this world we have built can and should be changed, you are wrong. If we were to walk away from our hard-won achievements there would be no other safe alternative beyond a world of darkness. While there has been much conflict, and much fear about who are the ‘other’ and the threat they are to our world, now our most important enemy, that which has shaped the history of our world and will shape your world as well, is not the outsider, the stranger, or any of our neighbours. It is within. In the year 2200 it will no longer matter if the threat that we face to protect our world will come from the north, or the south, or the east; the threat is still the same. It is within that we will face that danger, not because of others, but because of ourselves.\n\n", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Such high temperatures are required in order to accelerate the plasma to a useful velocity.\nA number of investigators, including J. S. Burch and M. Stahle (Plasma Sources Sci., 3, 65 (1994)) have demonstrated the feasibility of using a high power, highly directed laser beam, having a central axis to direct the high power beam to impinge on an explosive charge. Such beams have included a highly focused beam having a central axis to impinge upon an explosive charge. J. S. Burch and M. Stahle used a laser-based ignition system to initiate the detonation of an aluminum powder mixture in a closed chamber holding the mixture, which produced an ablation plasma having a temperature of 10,000.degree.K. A subsequent test demonstrated that a continuous ignition of a methane/nitrogen/oxygen mixture could produce 10,000 K plasma for 7 ms.\nUnfortunately, for most purposes, such sources must produce a high velocity thrust to operate, while maintaining very low heat deposition. This requires a plasma having a significantly higher temperature.\nTo do this, one approach would be to provide a focused laser beam of sufficient optical power to provide both optical excitation of the target gas and a source of optical fluence to cause the optical breakdown of the target gas into its constituent atomic or sub-atomic species. Such a laser excitation would provide the necessary optical energy to both excite the atoms and provide the required optical fluence. Once that is done, the remaining problems would be the confinement of the plasma itself.\nThis approach requires a well-directed, preferably collimated and possibly shaped, high power radiation beam that would be focussed onto the surface of the target fuel.\nA number of groups over the last", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Dietary sucrose has been shown to produce hyperammonaemia and impaired growth in rats. Studies have suggested that the effects observed might be related to the presence of the disaccharide in the diet. This study examined the effects of dietary sucrose on the plasma and urinary free amino acid (FAA) composition in the rat. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four dietary groups: standard rat chow (control diet), standard rat chow supplemented with sucrose (sucrose diet), sucrose-free rat chow (placebo diet) and standard rat chow containing sucrose and the disaccharide 2, 3, 5-tri-O-acetyl-D-ribitol (2:3-O-TRIAC:TRIAC diet). After 14 days of dietary treatment, the rats were killed and their plasma and urine collected, the latter of which was deproteinated. The FAA were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography or amino acid analysis. Rats on the sucrose-containing diets had significantly higher plasma and urinary ammonia (as a measure of increased nitrogen excretion) compared with the corresponding controls fed standard rat chow (P<0.05), while on the 2:3-O-TRIAC:TRIAC diet, they also had significantly higher plasma urea compared with all other groups (P<0.05). Rats on standard rat chow supplemented with sucrose had significantly lower plasma levels of all the aromatic AA but significantly higher levels of some essential AA compared with the controls, whereas on the 2:3-O-TRIAC:TRIAC diet, the opposite was found.

The present study examined whether the immune cells found in the epithelial layer and in nasal-associated lymphoid tissue had equivalent functional responses when stimulated in vitro and challenged in vitro. To induce immune responses, lymph node cells were incubated during 2 days with cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10) and with or without nasal antigen. The immune cells were then challenged by in vitro culture and exposure to rhubarb. The nasal NK cells and a subpopulation of NK cells, but not the majority of T cells, responded to rhubarb by increasing degranulation, killing and secreting cytokines. The nasal T cells were more responsive to IFN-γ. The NK cells were able to kill Rh mucosal vaccine-bearing bacteria even though this was not enhanced in the presence of IL-4. Since NK cells may be capable of producing IFN-γ when exposed to the nasal vaccine, they may be used effectively to enhance mucosal vaccine-induced immunity and in the eradication of the rhinovirus.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates generally to the fields of apoptosis and apoptosis detection. More particularly, it concerns the use of a caspase family inhibitor as a treatment and diagnostic agent for cancer.\n2. Description of Related Art\nCancer is a major public health problem worldwide. A wide variety of treatment options have been developed for cancer over the last few decades, including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, e.g. see “Chemotherapy” In: Lippincott-Raven E R, Fischman R A (Eds): Scientific American Medicine, W. B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, PA 1993, pp. 975-996.\nDespite great advances in oncological treatment, the overall 5-year survival rate for patients with advanced or metastatic cancer remains dismal, ranging from 24% for gastric adenocarcinoma to a mere 4% for advanced or metastatic Hodgkin lymphoma. Additionally, the 5-year survival rate for some types of cancer is now reported to be less than 10%. Therefore, significant efforts have been directed towards the identification and validation of novel targeted therapies to improve survival rates in various cancers.\nApoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that plays an important role in a broad spectrum of physiologic and pathologic events ranging from embryonic development to tissue homeostasis, and has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in some human cancers (reviewed in Evan et al., 2005, Nature Rev. Cancer 2005, 5:258). Caspases are one group of proteases that function to trigger the characteristic features of apoptosis. There are 10 caspase genes in mammalian cells, as classified from sequence homologies: caspase-1 (interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (ICE)), caspase-2 (IL-1 β-converting enzyme 2), caspase-3 (CPP-32; Caspase-I), caspase-4, caspase-5, caspase-6, caspase-7 (DeltapI), caspase-8 (FLICE) and caspase-9 (CPP-30; Caspase-IV).\nOne specific function of caspases is the inextricably linked process of cellular apoptosis, which involves a wide variety of morphological changes such as membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage, DNA fragmentation, and chromatin condensation (Kro", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

No. 5,822,539 that discloses a portable cell for electric shavers. A battery case consists of an upper and lower case including an internal cap for connection to an electric shaver.\nOne of the problems arising with the currently known known cells is the size of the battery. As electric shavers have been designed to be lighter and thinner, batteries have also reduced in size. This has particularly been the case for larger electric shavers. Hence, the available space for the storage of the battery becomes restricted.\nAnother problem with a battery such as defined in U.S. Pat. No. 5,822,539 is the safety. As such a case also includes an internal cap, the possibility to inadvertently remove it, for example when cleaning the shaver increases.\nThere is thus a need for a smaller battery that is safer by containing the battery in closed cases only, i.e., closed for all purposes.\nThere is also a need for such a battery that is more convenient to use, as it includes a more compact design than the currently existing shavers.\nThere is also a need for such a battery that has a size of the actual battery sufficient to handle the power requirements of electric shavers, but that has a reduced volume in relation to electric shavers of the same power.\nAccording to an aspect of the present invention there is provided a battery comprising: a first case including a hollow first case half having an open face and a first closed side and a second case half including a hollow second case half having an open face and a second closed side and being attached to the hollow first half such that the open face of the hollow first half faces the open face of the hollow second case half, and containing an electrode, a conductive member and an insulating member; a second case attached to the open face of the first case half and to the open face of the second case half; a first terminal of the electrode attached to the second case; an electrode extension extended from at least one of the first and second case halves and having a first terminal attached to the first terminal of the first case half and a second terminal; and a second terminal attached to the second case.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Whether it be President Donald Trump or the liberal left, one side or the other always seems to be the issue of the week on Twitter and social media. Immigration is always an easy talking point for both liberal and conservative and is the perfect way to continue our political rhetoric. This week, it is sanctuary cities and the recent controversy following the killing of illegal immigrant Luis Viana in Chicago.\n\nThe mayor of that city, Rahm Emmanuel, is a liberal, so therefore that is where the liberal rhetoric started. Then Donald Trump chimed in with his tweet following the incident. The debate seems to turn on a constant question. Is illegal immigration a crime or is it victimless? Is it a public safety threat or does it contribute to the economy? This is a conversation that most people have, but we are all guilty of forgetting we need to separate the fact that we are a nation of laws, but we are also a nation of compassion.\n\nIt is important we remember that as politicians, we are all guilty. The issue of immigration is a complicated issue and is only ever going to have a simple solution. The solution is not going to be a quick Band-Aid. To solve issues like immigration or sanctuary cities we need to understand the system and the underlying problems, then we need to understand the impact that would have if we solved those problems. We need to think about the consequences and if they help us achieve what we aspire to as a country. One of these solutions is to change the way our government works. It might mean a fundamental change in our election system, our justice system and changing how the media works.\n\nThis is a huge step for everyone to consider, but in order to take that step it will be necessary for us to examine what solutions are appropriate. For the last two presidential elections I’ve stood by and cried when Donald Trump won, I cried for Hillary Clinton also, but I also cried for America.

Semiconductor devices typically exhibit a very high density of electrical components. In order to operate at high speed, this density of electrical components demands small feature sizes. Many advances in the fabrication of semiconductor device have attempted to satisfy this demand.\nAs feature sizes are reduced and device size are reduced, one of the more difficult problems that arise relates to interconnects. This is particularly true for smaller devices, such as mobile devices, which must have a robust interconnect system having reliability to be considered practical. In an integrated circuit, the fabrication of the semiconductor components and the conductor structures requires a sequence of processing steps to be effective. A common fabrication process for semiconductor components starts with a silicon substrate having a planar upper surface, and a layer of a dielectric material covering the substrate. Patterning the dielectric layer defines locations where openings will later be formed. Conductive material (that is, interconnect material) is subsequently deposited to fill the openings. This process is repeated until the desired number of interconnect levels have been constructed. The process is often referred to as interconnect fabrication.\nIn the fabrication of interconnects, a common approach used for forming the conductive feature of the interconnect is a damascene process. This process involves forming an etch stop layer using a plasma deposition technique before the etch stop layer is over etched to form holes and trenches. An amorphous silicon layer is often formed and partially planarized in damascene processing. However, the amorphous silicon layer must include certain dopants, which is not typically included in the amorphous silicon layer formed by an ASG process. It is not practical for a metal film to be deposited on amorphous silicon because it has been found that such a process causes the amorphous silicon to oxidize. An interface layer must therefore be created for example by the formation of an amorphous silicon oxide layer on the surface of a metal before deposition of the other materials, such as a metal film. Unfortunately, in the formation of such an amorphous silicon oxide layer, the oxygen tends to react with the metal, which forms an oxide that is not capable of further oxidation. This is a particularly damaging problem resulting from a reaction of metals with oxygen during deposition of the oxide. The surface of the metal becomes oxidized before a robust, electrically", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Some elements of $V$ may not be mapped onto elements of $W$ under a given continuous map (e. g. the homomorphism $f(x,y)=y-x$). Therefore, I think, homomorphisms between general topological vector spaces can either be defined to be continuous, or continuous only if certain subsets don't contribute to the image.\nThus, if I get the homomorphism right with respect to that the image cannot depend on the homomorphism, we can just assume the homomorphisms be continuous automatically. Is this correct? I am not familiar with field homomorphisms of topological vector spaces in literature, so I don't know if this is the case.\n\nA:\n\nThis is right. This is a very good point that you make and so that is what I will assume. \nNow you state that there are certain sets of $V$ which don't contribute to the image of the homomorphism. \nIf you are allowed to make your definition of a homomorphism independent of your definition of continuity you will likely get away with $S_1$ and $S_2$ and so your question doesn't arise. \nIn a setting where there is a natural topology on $V$ and the homomorphism is required to be continuous as a map between topological spaces you will have to do some reasoning on what you may be able to omit. Such reasoning however may be subtle. An example of a setting where the setting of discontinuities will be a concern for you is in the field setting where the homomorphic fields are also supposed to be complete in addition to the topology (for the reason which you already stated). Then of course all the field elements will give continuous functions as soon as you fix a topology.\nThat said I think your basic point has merit.\n\n", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

However, the review team checked the citations of the eligible papers before entering the full-text data. Only studies reporting quantitative data, such as study-level numbers and measures of accuracy or precision, were entered. We chose to exclude studies in areas such as social sciences and qualitative research, where no standard quality assessment tools are available and we lack the skills to critically appraise the quality of studies. Studies not in English were excluded. This excludes all studies from LMICs.\n\nThe search strategy was designed to find articles focusing on either the quality of care or the use of CPGs. We excluded articles that simply discuss the value of CPGs, but do not examine quality of care. It would be useful to know both where CPGs are needed and where additional research is urgently needed.

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to the use of polyalkylene oxide-containing graft copolymers with sterically hindered phenolic resins and o-alkylstyrene copolymers for improving stabilization which protects the resins and elastomeric compositions against thermal degradation.\n2. Description of Prior Art\nMany phenolic resins are stabilized with phenolic resins by the combination of a phenolic resin and a copolymer derived from a diene monomer.\nThe phenolic resins are used alone or in combination with a variety of unsaturated monomers to provide a variety of useful products, such as butadiene-based rubbers, phenolic resins, phenolic novolakyne resins, and urethane resins. The butadiene-based rubbers are used alone or in combination with other resins, e.g., rubbers, tackifying resins, and elastomeric copolymers. Phenolic novolakyne resins are used in combination with isoprene rubber and other rubbers for providing good weatherproofing and antistatic properties, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,374,240.\nAn important parameter used to determine the effectiveness of stabilizing additives, such as polyalkylene oxide-containing graft copolymers, with phenolic resin for styrene/unsaturated monomer copolymers, is the induction period that is measured when samples of the polymer are placed in ovens at specific temperatures for periods of time. The induction period indicates the amount of time necessary for the phenolic resin to degrade to a certain level and is measured in degrees of stabilization.\nThe induction period should remain less than about 90 minutes at 210.degree. F. for a satisfactory level of stabilization. The stabilization should preferably be carried out over a temperature range of about 0.degree. to about 340.degree. F. The copolymer of a diene monomer and an unsaturated monomer, which is employed, can be, for example, an o-alkylstyrene copolymer, an isomonoolefin copolymer, an isobutylene/isoprene copolymer, a hydrocarbon copolymer, an alkyl acrylate copolymer, a vinyl chloride/vinyl acetate copolymer, a diene terpolymer, a diene block copolymer, polyisoprene or polybutadi", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

It is associated with increased risk of perioperative cardiorespiratory complications and, in the long term, with adverse outcomes. We compared the predictive value of perioperative plasma and tissue glucose levels for MOD in pediatric patients receiving surgery for repair of congenital heart disease, urinary tract anomalies, or other intraabdominal or lower extremity malformations. Our hypothesis was that the perioperative levels of both plasma and tissue glucose could predict the development of MOD in these patients. Using data from a prospective study conducted in the Pediatric Surgery Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a tertiary-care children's hospital between 2005 and 2010, we studied the relationship between the preoperative and intraoperative levels of plasma and tissue glucose and MOD in 30 surgical patients (median age 6 mo, range 1-23 mo). MOD was present in 73% of all patients. A positive association was found between an intraoperative plasma glucose level of ≥ 10mmol/L and the occurrence of MOD on Day 1 [odds ratio 4.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28-14.48; p = 0.019] and Days 2-4 (odds ratio 9.64; 95% CI 2.16-42.55; p = 0.003). An intraoperative tissue glucose level of ≥ 10 mmol/g predicted the occurrence of MOD on Day 1 (odds ratio 2.54; 95% CI 1.23-5.24; p = 0.01) and on Day 2-4 (odds ratio 6.08; 95% CI 2.27-16.29; p < 0.001). The preoperative level of tissue glucose (p = 0.025) as well as the decrease in tissue glucose levels (p = 0.035) over the first week postoperatively correlated positively with the MOD score at Day 7.

Instead we need to look at the definitions themselves.\n\nSo when we consider work done by a person as being good or great, it is based on certain standards. This can be because of the amount of work produced, or the level of skill and abilities of the person at their craft.\n\nBut as the amount of work produced or level of skill is something that we are likely to compare many things with. Is this to say then that in a specific example, we can never compare a master craftsman, or a person of average skill to a master engineer.\n\nThis answer can be considered an out of touch statement as well, as it is an obvious truth that, an engineer or work of art like say a clock or sculpture is of no comparison to a person’s skill.\n\nThis brings us back to looking at the definitions, and what the standards are and what the goals set will be.\n\nIt should be noted, that this will also apply to the standards of a people and culture, since a nation will likely be formed from the set of standards of the people.\n\nWe are talking about things that are of the highest quality and standards. We are talking about a great works of art, or a great piece of music, or a great sculpture.\n\nWe are talking about the greatest achievements of a nation. If we look at what our greatest achievements are to be found, we would notice and we would be able to understand the difference between a good and a great piece of work.\n\nWhen we talk about the United State of America, we can quickly say the greatest achievements of our people is in science and the arts.

Moreover, it is very frequently desired to be able to configure, for example, the mixing of different substances to be present only a single unit to carry out such a process.\nGerman Patent Document DE-A-3,904,626 discloses a solution for the preparation of a mixture. According to that patent, a mixture is stored in a liquid vessel. A piston which is arranged in the liquid vessel in a freely movably manner is provided with a mixer which is in the form of a scraper conveyor. The piston is provided with recesses in the form of a channel. In addition, the piston is equipped with a mixing element at the outlet of the channel. This mixing element produces a pressure wave in the liquid being mixed so that it is possible to work in safety without any particular problem. Due to its specific construction, however, that solution is unsuitable for the use in an office automation device for the preparation of a mixture which requires only a small number of operating personnel.\nIt is therefore an object of the invention to develop a device and a corresponding method for the preparation of a mixture which is suitable in particular for office use.\nThis object is achieved with a device in accordance with the invention wherein the mixing element is a simple valve which is connected fixedly to a mixing tube. It is therefore possible to prepare a mixture using the described device from the fixedly connected mixing tube so that it is possible to have the same mixture which is ready at any desired time.\nIn addition, the valve is designed in a very simple manner, so that it can be used particularly in an office automation device which has a small physical design.\nAn especially preferred embodiment of this connection is achieved by the valve being made of plastic, with the mixing tube being arranged as a rigid part in a groove of the valve and the valve, including the mixing tube mounted in a casing provided with the groove. Through its simple design, this embodiment has an especially small physical size, and it is very well usable, for example for a cartridge-type device.\nIn a", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

More particularly, the present invention relates to water-in-oil emulsion and sprayable polymer compositions such as polyaspartamide which are particularly adapted for use on or in agricultural crops as protective and/or growth enhancing agents.\nVarious polymeric emulsions have been developed which are sprayable. These emulsions are typically water-in-oil emulsions which are formed by mixing and emulsifying various polymeric resins with water in an aqueous emulsifier or surfactant. The combination of emulsifier and resin is, however, typically not stable at high shear rates nor is it sufficiently stable for high speed production of large volumes of sprayable coatings on farms. Additionally, it is often very difficult to spray these emulsions onto agricultural crops.\nFurther, many commercially available resin compositions have low viscosity characteristics which make these resin compositions highly susceptible as coating dispersions. In addition, the resin compositions are not particularly sprayable.\nThus, a need exists for sprayable emulsions including one or more polymeric resins which are thermally and/or radiation stable, have an acceptable viscosity, are easy to apply and are effective for protecting agricultural crops against insects such as insects and/or diseases.\nThus, the present invention relates to novel sprayable emulsion and resin compositions which meet the need outlined above. More particularly, the present invention relates to water-in-oil emulsion and sprayable polymer compositions comprising at least about 40% by weight of a water-in-oil emulsion resin having a solids content of about 15% to about 30% by weight of solid matter, more preferably between about 16% and 29% by weight of solid matter, a solids/water ratio of from between about 1.3:1 and about 2.5:1, and a pH less than about 8.0.\nThe novel sprayable emulsions contain the polyaspartamide composition of the present invention as a polymer. These sprayable emulsions also contain a water-in-oil emulsifying agent. The emulsifying agent is most preferably an emulsifying or emulsion modifying agent. These emulsions contain the water-in-oil emulsion resin, the emulsifier, surfactant and water. The addition of these components is essential to the effectiveness of the emulsion for protecting agricultural crops.\nAny aque", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

From 2001 to 2007, 26 out of 33 patients with acute AC dislocation were operated on in the Urological department of a level III trauma center. Three patients with chronic AC dislocation were treated arthroscopically. Patients with associated injuries including clavicle and axillary fracture/dislocation, brachial plexus injury and acute trauma cases were included. The mean followup time was 22 months (range: 12-44) and 12 months (range: 3-12) for arthroscopic and open surgical interventions respectively. The mean age was 29 (range: 19-42) years. Eighteen out of 26 patients had previous trauma to the shoulder joint. All patients complained of shoulder pain on history. Three patients had mild shoulder pain after trauma while the other 23 patients had anterior shoulder pain which was aggravated during abduction and resisted abduction maneuvers such as throwing a ball or swimming. There were no associated clavicle or axillary fracture/dislocations. The mean Constant score was 85 (range: 0-100) before surgery and improved to 90 (range: 0-100) after surgery. For arthroscopic surgery (7 patients), mean Constant score improved from 69 to 88 post surgery; while for open surgery (10 patients), mean Constant score improved from 91 to 98.

Patients who had no history of trauma were operated for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The average time gap between the trauma and surgery was 2 weeks. Seven patients had residual pain and reduced active motion. All patients had good functional outcomes based on the constant score improvement and excellent patient satisfaction.

I enjoy watching and attending football games at a sports bar. However this year, my love for football has faded since the Cowboys haven't been able to win. Last year they made the playoffs, this is the first year I've been truly disappointed. Plus, I just don't get too excited about regular season. It just doesn't matter, except to football junkies like me. That and I like to think the Patriots will get the big prize for winning the past 16 years.\n\nAs the Dallas Cowboy's were losing, I was watching the rest of the Super Bowl festivities. One of the best things about Super Bowl Sunday is the food and entertainment that happens outside. If you're on a budget, you can even make a lot of the food yourself. I'm taking over the stove and you only need a recipe to have a healthy, cheap supper that will warm you through and through. I'm talking about the best Super Bowl party food ever!\n\nYou're probably thinking \"but Mina, that's not supper, that's a dessert\". Believe me, I am fully aware of the difference, so I'm going to make a point. This is supper. I have yet to cook chicken enchiladas for a party. I had chicken wraps made a few years ago using chicken breast. I have yet to make wings. I'm not saying it wouldn't be delicious, because I am sure it would be. But the point is, I don't like to spend a lot of money when it comes to Super Bowl day. I'd like to save that money for other things like tickets and other fun food and festivities.\n\nThere is no chicken enchilada in sight, no wings being cooked right now and there will be no chicken wraps for me to make this year. Instead of spending money on other Super Bowl weekend food, I have made chicken fajitas with corn chips. You may think that's not worth mentioning. But I want to make a point that food isn't a big deal. You don't have to spend a lot of money (or even that much money) so stop thinking it is. It isn't.\n\nSo the real question is do you care to be one of the three people who know about these amazing chicken fajitas? Because they're not good for just one.

The correlation between the new and the traditional estimates of gene content is good; a coefficient of correlation of 0.94 is obtained.

As a consequence, it has become critically important to develop more efficient network protocols to support such systems and to facilitate communications utilizing the internet protocol.\nThe internet protocol is a connectionless protocol that enables the transmission of data from a sender to a receiver in the form of data frames. Each data frame has destination and source addresses to enable the receiver to route the data frame to its intended destination. Other data frames may be transmitted between the sender and a router that services the destination network address. Each router and every node on the internet or private network is capable of acting as both a sender, router, and destination network. A router or network device may process IP data frames in various ways before transmitting or sending the data frames to their final destination. For example, a router or network device may perform a checksum of the IP packet on the network to detect transmission errors. When such an error is detected, the router may transmit a message packet back to the source of the data frame. Packet traffic transmitted between network devices on the internet or private network can traverse many different paths between the source and the destination. To handle this situation, routers or similar network devices implement one of various routing algorithms to determine the best or least expensive way to route the data frame between given source and destination addresses. It is well known in the art to utilize either the distance vector algorithm, such as the Routing Information Protocol (RIP), or the link-state algorithm, such as the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) algorithm to determine the path between an internet source and destination. It is also well known in the art to utilize the “next hop” of a network packet to determine the optimal path through a router, etc.\nIn a network utilizing the IP protocol, when a data frame is sent from a sender to a destination, there is no guarantee that the information in the data frame will reach its destination. Consequently, IP is not a reliable communication protocol. The concept of a quality of service (QOS) has been implemented in computer systems that use the IP protocol in order to provide some degree of predictability of the delivery of data from one network address to another. In order for the QOS scheme to be effective, the packets are marked with quality level values in order to help the receiver of the packets determine their delivery quality.

However, no standardized therapy exists for its treatment. Dapsone is an effective treatment for acne and dermatologic conditions without significant adverse effects. Its efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in adults with rosacea, but little is known about its effects in children. To assess the clinical efficacy and safety of a dapsone 0.1% gel in a patient population with rosacea. Patients were randomized to apply dapsone 0.1% gel once daily over the forehead and/or cheeks for 2 months. Efficacy measures were the physician's global assessment (0-4) and child patient and investigator global assessments. Adverse events were assessed weekly. One hundred twenty children were randomized into 2 arms, with 60 children per arm. The groups had comparable demographics and baseline characteristics. At the end of 2 months of therapy, there was a statistically significantly greater reduction in the physician's global assessment scores in all 3 of the study areas in the dapsone 0.1% arm than the vehicle arm (P <.05).

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to novel aqueous pigment-solution printing inks and compositions for use therewith. More specifically, the present invention relates to aqueous pigment-solution printing inks having an improved water balance and to the compositions useful therewith.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nPigment-solution printing inks have the property that they can be used in the presence of water. More specifically, since they must be present at some stage during the printing process, aqueous pigment-solution inks are typically present in a substantially stable form.\nHowever, due to their water content, these printing inks require certain precautions and controls to ensure the quality of the finished product. If they are not properly processed and shipped, they will cause a reduction in the image quality of the finished paper. On the other hand, if the inks are kept in an open system, they may cause a condition known as \"cockling\" in the final image, or may cause the printed images to shrink excessively during drying. Also, as a consequence of their water content, aqueous pigment-solution inks are less stable than other types of ink, and can suffer from coagulation if left on a surface after drying.\nThe pigment which is used in the aqueous pigment-solution inks typically contains a binder polymer. The binder polymer is typically a polymer of a monomer having a low molecular weight such as a low molecular weight aldehyde (e.g. a dimethylol propionic aldehyde) having a number average molecular weight of under 100,000; a reactive diluent which is inert upon admixture to the pigment and which does not react with the binder polymer; and additives such as wetting agents, defoamers, plasticizers, rheology modifiers and the like.\nPigment-solution printing inks are typically formulated by a mixture of the aqueous components which are necessary to properly control the printing process including, but not limited to, wetting agents, wetting control assistants, film formation assistants, defoamers, rheology modifiers, defoaming assistants, and a diluent. The aqueous components of these pigment-solution inks must be carefully formulated to obtain the correct relative proportions of certain of these components and to ensure that the rheology (that is, flow) and viscosity of the inks", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Instead, government can direct service providers to comply with the new requirements. The committee did recommend that the government require internet service providers to block websites that appear to be used for the distribution or exchange of child pornography.\n\nAnother example is the prohibition that the committee wants that prohibits an Internet access provider from blocking lawful content with some degree of specificity. There is an ambiguity as to what might be construed as lawful content: it could be just any content that is on the list. As it stands now, any content that the government does not find a legal reason not to block is a legal matter.\n\nAnother point the committee made is that in order to comply with a law enforcement order to disable access to content, service providers would need to notify the user and give them notice and an opportunity to opt out of being affected by the order. There are no requirements for the service provider to give this information to the individual and without the protection of individual rights to due process, there is no question that the business of service providers will be affected by law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe bill does contain a good measure of privacy protections for both service providers and consumers. The bill would prohibit the government and third-party business entities from accessing a customer’s stored data without warrant or a court order. There are provisions that would allow the courts to set reasonable limits to the duration, timing and frequency when data may be accessed.\n\nFinally, the bill has a good set of provisions that give protection to customers when data is shared with a third-party for business purposes.\n\nWhile the bill is not perfect, it will likely be better than much of what was discussed last session.\n\nThe bill was introduced by Ron Kind, D-Wisconsin, and was co-signed by six additional Republicans and two Democrats.\n\nThere are eight Republican cosponsors this session and the bill is set to have a hearing March 9.\n\nAs we have discussed in prior blogs, while there is no guarantee that the legislation will pass, the likelihood is", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "yes", "misinformation": "“One of the things that I saw when coming in, is that the government has the power to stop any new business owner from using technology in his or her business,” said Brian Sall, CFO of BPMFusion. <<<“This will put a lot of the younger, more start-up ideas or smaller businesses out of business.”>>>", "scoreMisinformation": 2}

It is the one that made them a rock star. If they never played again and disappeared off of the stage, the dead legacy would still be as strong and still be heard. This was the show that made it happen.\n\nBest Song. Easily this one again. I will go back in time and rank all the songs they performed here, but it is a pretty good list to be honest. A perfect setlist from the second night. A few of them are among the all-time ones. But there are others. \"Jack Straw\" may not be as well known as some songs. But from a live context its transcendental. It would be just as good if we saw Jerry on the drums for this one. \"Casey Jones\" has a place in history and the dead legacy is stronger when viewed from this perspective. But if we hear this song, we think of this show. And when we think of this show, it is remembered more fondly.\n\nBest Box. The fact that the box for this show has been signed makes it even more prized, as well as being signed by the band.

The gaseous hydrocarbon stream is freed from the aqueous solution and the hydrocarbon-air gas mixture is conducted as a product gas to a second stage of a CO2 absorption column (see WO 08/077969 A1; FIGS. 1 and 2).\nAt the second stage, a circulating aqueous ammonia or urea solution absorbs CO2 from an external air stream, by chemical conversion of urea (CH4N2O2) or ammonia NH3) to carbonates. The CO2-contaminated solution is supplied by a pump in a recirculation circuit to the first stage of the absorption column, and is separated thereupon from a part of the circulating ammonia or urea solution which is freed from CO2 and recirculated in addition to a part of the ammonia or urea solution which is recycled for the absorption of CO2 in the first stage. The aqueous solution which is recycled for the absorption of CO2 at the first stage contains, at most, 5.5% by volume of ammonium carbamate and in the second stage is additionally at least 95% depleted of CO2. In such a manner, a liquid stream containing CO2 is formed, which is transferred from the second stage to a regeneration column and to a storage tank for CO2 for the formation of an aqueous alkali metal carbonate solution.\nAlthough an arrangement of this type for the recovery of CO2 leads to energy savings of approximately 8 to 10% compared to known prior art, it still has considerable disadvantages. Depending on the configuration, depending on the application, the required flow rate, etc., in the recirculation circuit for the recovery of CO2 can be reduced considerably. This results in an increase in the energy required for the CO2-recovery section and for the CO2 regeneration, which cannot be covered even by a combination of various approaches so far", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a liquid developer used for developing electrostatic latent images formed on an electrophotographic photoconductor and more particularly, to a liquid developer which is excellent in dispersibility, fluidity, and the quality of solid particles and which can attain both high density and high image quality.\n2. Discussion of Background\nAs shown in FIG. 1, a conventional liquid developer used for developing latent images formed on an electrophotographic photoconductor has a carrier liquid A consisting of kerosene having dispersed therein pigment particles B suspended in a non-aqueous liquid medium. Such carriers are classified into inorganic carrier particles and organic carrier particles. Aqueous solutions (including micro-capsules and micro-emulsions) containing inorganic or organic pigment particles are used as well. Further, they are available in the form of dispersions having a particle diameter of several dozens of microns to 1,000 microns.\nIn order to cause the liquid pigment particles dispersed in carrier liquid A to come close to the surface of the non-aqueous carrier liquid, and also to prevent the particles from moving in a shear field and in the absence of a stabilizer by the stirring of the carrier liquid, it has been proposed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,546,060 to use a cationic or non-ionic colloid dispersing agent having a long hydrocarbon chain having a HLB value of 11 or more. However, a conventional technique using a cationic colloid dispersing agent is defective in that only non-ionic ones are soluble in the carrier liquid and this makes it impossible to control the charge characteristics of the liquid developer which is to be achieved by the addition of a specific inorganic or organic pigment.\nOn the other hand, JP-A-63-222217 proposes a carrier liquid containing a dispersion of a monomer or modified monomer polymer. These carrier liquids are mainly used for a purpose of achieving high speed recording.\nA conventional technique for controlling the charge of the carrier liquid having dispersed the pigment particles is not capable of imparting a stable charge amount to the carrier liquid to be circulated after development. Further, the dispersion of pigment particles in the carrier liquid causes the particles to sediment and adhere to the surface of the apparatus or to the surface of the electrophotographic photoconductor where the liquid developer is applied thereon for development. As a result, it is necessary to clean not only the apparatus but also", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Field of the Invention\nThe invention relates to the field of networked computer systems and, more specifically, to computer systems with multiple processor types, such as a client and a server in the network.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nComputer systems often are configured to have a client portion, a server portion, and a switching portion or switching network that interconnects the client portion and the server portion. In these systems or environments, the client portion is capable of executing programs for carrying out data manipulations and transactions. The server portion executes programs to service client requests. The switching network provides network routing services between clients and servers. In general, the client portion may be made up of some number of logical, virtual, or logical/virtual machines distributed across one or more physical machines. Typically, the client portion contains a physical processor that is capable of carrying out processing operations in response to network requests. In such arrangements, the number of such logical/virtual machines may be greater than the number of the physical machines. In some cases, each logical/virtual machine may also have some number of logical processors or logical threads and may be physically located on a different physical or logical machine. Alternatively, each logical/virtual machine may represent a discrete entity, such as a service or group of services, that may be provided within one or more physical machines operating in parallel to one another.\nIn any of these environments, a host application, or thread may execute in one of the logical, virtual, or logical/virtual machines. Some systems may include several types of application execution. For example, a client may have a server in a server environment, client applications, such as browser applications (e.g. http, html), a web server, and e-mail server applications. A browser application may contain web pages that are accessed by other browser applications in client computers (e.g. http, html, applets). A web server application may contain web pages that are accessed by other client applications (e.g. http, html, and applet); web server applications may be part of a web server or a web sever agent that contains many http, html, and applet applications.

So you’ve probably got the idea, already. If you think bondage is just about being chained to something or having someone tie you up, you’re wrong.\n\nLet's call this thing sex.\n\nSex can be about a lot than just getting off. Sex can be about getting to know someone well and spending time together. Sex can be about using your imagination with a partner or getting off through mutual fantasy. Sex can be about foreplay, intercourse, masturbation, roleplaying, analingus–you name it, as long it involves two or more people. And as long as it brings you satisfaction, sex is the best thing you could ever do for yourself.\n\nIt’s also possible, however, for bondage to be an ingredient in sex. Some people might find it exciting to see a lover tie them up and take them on a wild bondage ride, or even have them tied to a desk, with their wrists behind their back. It’s possible for people to want to experiment with bondage scenes in a safe, controlled environment, instead of leaving themselves open to random acts of violence. In these sorts of cases, bondage play might be a way to turn your sex into a form of rough sex.\n\nWhat’s the difference between rough sex and bondage? Rough sex typically involves pain. And if you ask sexpert Dr. Drew Hyers, “What’s the difference between sadomasochism and bondage?” the answer is that there isn’t a big difference between the two.\n\n“In rough sex, there is often some sort of pain involved,” says Hyers. (Anal sodomy is rough sex.) “There is rough sex, with whips and chains, or people being choked or spanked. And there is bondage-without-pain. Sometimes it's used as a way to make the rough sex safe and nonthreatening for a certain purpose. This is common in BDSM playrooms, where a beginner might practice a couple of skills before adding harder bondage that involves pain.”\n\nThere are a lot of ways to practice bondage.

The gas-measuring instrument is arranged in the housing which serves to transfer all rotary movements of the instrument to the housing, in order to make it pivotable when it carries a second axis of rotation about a pivotal (axis of rotation) on the reference. The pivotal axis represents the driving axis for the gas-measuring instrument.\nThe pivotal axis is pivotally connected to a shaft which is rotatably held in the housing. The latter shaft, in turn, is formed by an elongate element, which comprises the shaft and an adjacent portion of the housing which serves to guide rotary movements of the shaft from the housing to the pivotal axis and vice versa. In the same way the housing serves to provide a driving force for rotary movements of the shaft (element) as a result of the relative rotation between the housing and the reference. On the other hand the elongate member serves to provide a mechanical coupling between the housing and the reference in order to ensure that the housing remains stationary relative to the fixed reference.\nIn order to allow the gas-measuring instrument to be connected to a measuring line, there is provided in the housing a first orifice (i.e. opening) which can be connected, via a coupling (clamp) with a further orifice in the wall to which the measuring line is connected via a further orifice, and thereby to enable a gas to flow from the mixture of the liquid and gas through the measuring line to the measuring instrument. Typically, the measuring line is connected in a conventional manner with a further orifice in the wall to which a hose is connected via a hose coupler.

Field of the Invention\nThe invention relates to a novel method of controlling the process of the recovery of oil, gas and mineral matter from subterranean strata at temperatures below that at which the fluids are gaseous, the fluids being produced from boreholes at the bottom of such strata by the process of hydraulic fracturing. The invention consists in the use of water-soluble polymers as proppant materials. There is thereby produced a more rapid and more complete closure of the permeability channels and a greater quantity of material is held in suspension in the fluids at the surface of the earth. The method of the invention is to be distinguished in principle from those known by the general term of the \"fracturing\" process, although the method and material are the same in essential respects.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nOil fields have long been exploited by pumping water into the wells at the bottom of the earth and recovering the oil by pumping it to the ground surface. The principal cause of depletion of the fields and of the rise in the cost of the process is the viscosity of the oil which resists the passage of the water and oil through porosity in the rock. A number of processes has been developed, which reduce this viscosity. A process of very wide applicability which includes hydraulic fracturing has been brought into general use by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This requires the injection of water into the rock at a pressure sufficient to overcome the resistance of the rock structure of the formation. The injection and its consequences are accompanied by the migration of particles which fill the pores and so reduce the resistance to the flow of the fluids and of their products. Particles of a very wide range of materials are used as proppants including quartz, carbon black, polystyrene fibers, glass beads, walnut shells, wood and the shells of diatoms.\nThe oil wells developed in recent years have the potential for the production of fluids and minerals from underground strata at lower temperatures than hitherto possible, the lower temperatures being necessary for the production of gas, which is more readily separated into its constituents when it is under pressure. When the gas is natural gas the pressure is comparatively low, of about 5 to 40 kilograms per square centimeter, while at the same time the temperature rises to as high as 200.degree. C. Where the rock strata contain oil it is possible to pump the oil up, even at lower temperature but the result is that the oil is very viscous even at", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Nucleoids of different eukaryotes, especially plants, have been the focus of much recent interest, primarily due to their potential applications in biotechnology. These include the use of nucleolar proteins and ribonucleic acid (RNA) components in synthetic biology. An interesting feature of the nucleoid is its dynamic behavior in cells and tissues over a wide range of physiological situations. It is hypothesized that the dynamic behaviour of the nucleoid is due to the dynamic changes in structure that could be caused by a number of factors including: altered physiological states, various treatments, and interactions with cell components that carry out various functions. Structural alterations in nucleoids may affect the organization and/or functioning of the cell. Therefore, the nucleoidal dynamics may be of fundamental significance to cell function. The structure of plant cell organelles is not well studied, but the nucleoid is one of the most highly conserved features of eukaryotic cells. Because they are composed of nucleic acids and structurally very similar proteins, and are of vital importance to cells, it seems likely that nucleoid components that interact with many other cell compartments play a role in many cellular functions. For example, the nucleoid can change in response to physiological, environmental, and cell treatment conditions, and these changes can affect nucleoid organization and the structure of nucleolar components in a cell. The effect of the nucleoid on other cellular organelles is unknown. However, it is clear that the nucleoid and organells share proteins and other macromolecular complexes. This review will discuss the properties of organelles, and highlight the potential interactions between organelles. This includes the nucleoid and mitochondria, as well as the perinucleolar compartment, which has not been extensively studied.

A hollow spindle is attached near the bottom of the valve at one end, and an internal poppet is located between the spring and spindle, so that the needle is biased closed but can be forced outward by the action of the cam lobe against the spindle, causing it to pass outwardly through the hollow spindle and open the spray orifice at the top of the injector head. After fuel enters, the spring causes the needle to close by the force of its own return spring.\nNozzles that operate in this manner must be able to supply fuel to the cylinder reliably throughout the injection cycle. An important factor in the atomization of the injected fuel, which is essential for accurate timing, is the diameter of the spray orifice at the top of the injector head. This size determines the ratio of injector efficiency to required injector orifice size. The spray orifice diameter should generally be larger than the needle orifice to ensure efficient injection. Too large, and an excessive gap is formed between the needle and spray orifice, resulting in incomplete fuel filling and poor fuel atomization. Too small, and a back pressure builds which may result in incomplete injections.\nThe diameter of the orifice may be varied by changing the relative positions of the needle and spray orifice relative to each other. There are two main ways of providing this. One is to change the diameter of the spray orifice. This is accomplished by either redesigning the injector head to vary this size, or by providing a variable orifice. A variable orifice requires a mechanical linkage to move an orifice member in or out of the passage of the injector head. Variable orifices require constant adjustment, or they can result in variable fuel injection rate characteristics. In externally injected engines that operate on high pressure fuel such as the present day BMW inline-5 or Porsche 911 engines, there is no way to adjust the spray orifice diameter after the injector head is installed in the cylinder head of the engine, so that use of variable orifice nozzles is impractical.\nThe second main way of changing orifice diameter is to provide a cam lobe on the needle valve shaft to", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

An interface has the same power as a pure abstract and it might be more useful when you get to that kind of problem.\nThe syntax of the language is not natural and can be confusing at first. One cannot think it is just the 'common' method of declaring an object to which you want others to inherit when he is in fact implementing a contract.\nIt has a reputation for being 'a bit of a mess'.

The machine comprises a cutting tool whose tool head is constituted by a main portion provided in a rotary movement or swivelling axis and a removable cutting element whose tool bit can be put in position on the main portion of the tool head on the swivelling axis.\nThe tool is used to cut notches in tubular workpieces made of hard metal, in this instance a steel that is in particular to be cut by using laser beams.\nIt may happen that with the tool thus constituted it is necessary to make a certain number of the notches at the same time and this involves the tool having to be returned to the cutting position and then moved away, for the notches in which it is necessary to introduce new cutting elements and to remove those in which it is sufficient to proceed with maintenance work on the tool head.\nIt is thus of interest to have a device for managing tools of the kind indicated that allows such tools to be easily and rapidly returned to their cutting position, without giving rise to risk of loss of control of the tool during this movement, and subsequently to move away from the cutting position for maintenance operations. Additionally, the device should be very simple and particularly well adapted to facilitate rapid return of the tool to the cutting position.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

It looked like she had the flu, but the girl's mother was worried. Instead of heading to the doctor, Katie's mom took her to see a naturopath instead, hoping that would work.\n\n\"I remember going to this naturopath who wasn't really doing anything differently,\" Katie's mom Sara Lusk told us. \"The whole experience wasn't so different than what I would have gotten at the doctor.\"\n\nSara Lusk didn't know that after Katie got better, she kept asking for the doctor's number.\n\n\"As I was looking things up online, I found something interesting. There was a website with a lot of questions about vaccines and things like that,\" she said.\n\nKatie's mom sent the questions to Dr. William Wulf, who runs a clinic in Green Bay, and is a member of the American College of Physicians and the American Family Physician.\n\nDr. William Wulf: \"If those kids really have a real illness, would vaccines be going to have any effect?\"\n\nKatie Lusk: \"Yes.\"\n\nIt doesn't matter if that's the opinion of a naturopath, a chiropractor, a naturopath that's working with kids, or a mother searching the Internet for answers.\n\nThis is something Katie's mom believes in.

We have generated transgenic mice that overexpress CRHR1 exclusively in brain and have found that these animals respond to stress with elevated plasma corticosterone (CORT), altered ACTH levels, and hypersecretion of gonadotropin, luteinizing Hormone and prolactin, yet have normal plasma CORT levels at 24 weeks of age. The effect of CRHR1 on ACTH is also greater in CRHR1 than CRHR2 deficient brains. Our initial analyses of testicular weights suggest that CRHR1 can also increase steroidogenesis, because testis weights increase with age in CRHR1, unlike in wild type. Other data suggest that CRHR1 can regulate other neurohormonal systems and affect behavior (and vice versa). The first objective of this project therefore is to characterize the actions of CRHR1 in central brain and pituitary and the role of endogenous CRH in regulating CRHR1 actions, both in stress and under basal or stressful conditions. CRHR1 mRNA and protein levels will be investigated since preliminary data suggest that the mRNA levels are markedly elevated in brain under basal, unstressed conditions. Preliminary data presented in Project 3 shows that brain CRHR2 content is increased in response to increased basal CORT levels. It is unknown whether such changes are due to increased CRH expression (and therefore CRHR1/CRHR2 expression) or increased CRHR1/CRHR2 mRNA stability. CRHR2 levels will be studied to determine if they are increased in response to high plasma CORT but only CRHR1, CRHR2 and CRH protein will be studied to determine if basal brain CRH levels are increased. Since basal plasma CORT and ACTH levels are normal in CRHR1 KO mice with increased brain CRHR1, the second objective of the proposed project is to determine the role of basal, endogenous CRH in regulating pituitary ACTH in basal and stressed conditions. CRH will be stimulated exogenously to determine if CRH can induce its own secretion in brain and/or ACTH secretion. CRHR1 KO and CRHR2 KO mice will be used to determine if basal CORT levels vary in these mouse models. Other brain regions and", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

More particularly, the invention relates to an improved technique for displaying mammographic information (e.g., breast tissue and lesion information) based on the detection of abnormalities of soft tissue in a breast (e.g., breast mass and lymph node) in mammographic images.\nAbnormalities of soft tissue in a breast, such as breast mass and lymph node are a major cause for breast biopsies in mammography. One important challenge in computer-aided mammography is to detect breast abnormalities reliably and automatically from mammography images that include both glandular and soft tissue details by a computer. Mammograms of the breast typically include radiographic images of the breast as well as associated soft tissue and glands of the breast, e.g., the breast tissue surrounding the glandular region of the breast. In order to detect abnormalities, it is therefore important for a computer processing mammography system to correctly identify and demarcate the breast regions for detection of abnormalities, and locate and extract the abnormalities from the mammographic image.\nCurrently, there are mainly two approaches utilized for the detection of breast abnormalities from a radiographic image of the breast. First, the radiographic image of the breast is acquired and then the abnormal breast tissues (e.g., breast mass or lymph node) are detected from the radiographic image of the breast. A mammography image acquisition machine used for the mammography image can be a conventional mammography machine or a high penetration (HP) system that acquire the radiographic mammography image. Examples of mammography image acquisition machines include Senographe 2000D, Senographe DC and Sensotec DXe. In this approach, although the radiographic image provides detailed information of both the breast tissue as well as abnormalities of the soft tissue of the breast, detection of abnormalities of the soft tissue of the breast requires image processing of the radiographic mammography image, and hence this approach is relatively time consuming.\nAnother widely used approach for identifying and demarcating abnormal breast tissues (e.g., abnormal breast mass or lymph nodes) from the surrounding tissues is to segment the region and analyze pixels within the segmented region for the presence of abnormalities in the breast tissues. Typical algorithms for segmenting the radiographic image of the breast and locating and extracting abnormal tissues have been described in U.S. Pat.

More particularly, the invention relates to an electrostatographic printer or copier having multiple ink paths which permit a higher resolution print head print zone to print an image. Specifically the invention relates to an electrographic printer, such as a printer for an inkjet printer, having multiple ink paths that reduce the inkjet nozzle volume.\nInkjet printers typically include a print media platen, a print head, and a drive for the platen and print head. The print head forms a print image on a sheet of print media as it traverses the platen to which the sheet is attached. The print media is typically held in place on the platen by a gripper system which may include fingers that engage the bottom of the print media. To ensure that the print head has an unobstructed view of the print media, the platen must be capable of movement. To produce sharper prints and to allow the printer to run faster, the current technology in printers is to have the media travel at ever increasing speeds. The faster the print media travels, the more likely mechanical problems will occur that will impact the ability of the printer to continue operating.\nInkjet print heads create a dot matrix by firing ink droplets from the nozzles of the print head. The print head typically is the only mechanical part of the printer to experience wear. If the print head is not held in proper alignment relative to the paper path, print defects may occur. Print defects are very apparent in a black, or solid color, print. The problem of print defect is so great that some ink may be placed on the print media in the area outside of the print head to ensure that no print defects occur.\nThe use of the same reference symbols in different drawings indicates identical items unless otherwise noted. The words “print,” “printer” and the word “printing” are used here interchangeably in reference to the formation of an image on a print medium.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a system and method for use in providing service to subscriber line services that operate over the subscriber's existing telephone system.\n2. Description of Related Art\nThe proliferation of computers and the growing popularity and use of the Internet for communications has made information readily available to subscribers of the telephone system. In particular, the World wide Web, or “Web,” provides a useful method of sharing information via the Internet, as well as providing electronic mail services. Such electronic capabilities, combined with a subscriber's desire for online services that are not available to the subscriber via the telephone system, present an attractive arrangement.\nHowever, it has proved difficult to fully leverage the capabilities of many of the “outside” services available to a subscriber, in particular through the use of the telephone system. For example, a “virtual private network” (VPN) is a subscriber's communications scheme involving dialing into a telecommunications provider and establishing a connection. The subscriber communicates using a particular set of electronic encryption keys while the telecommunications provider uses a different set, to protect the subscriber's confidentiality. Once the connection is established between the two parties, one can use online services to conduct electronic business, via a dedicated line. Although VPNs are popular with Internet-based businesses, these services can be difficult and expensive to use through the telephone system.\nAdditionally, the ability of the telephone system to provide these “outside” services is limited by the services of such services' providers, for example because of licensing considerations. For example, Bell Atlantic, MCAT and AT&T Global Services (BGS) have entered into a licensing arrangement related to outside line services, referred to as BLS, whereby a licensee agrees to establish a dedicated line to the provider's network, and to provide to the provider the dedicated line number for the outside service and the subscriber number for that line. Consequently, BLS services provide telephone numbers and associated telephone line service to the parties that have licensed access to these lines. Because many customers subscribe to several outside services, it is difficult for the provider to assure that dedicated lines are available to customers who subscribe to certain outside services, and it is difficult for the provider to bill for the additional traffic associated with the use of a particular outside line.\nFurthermore, each carrier has a different fee for a particular outside service. The service is provided by the “owner” of the outside line, and a service agreement is usually entered into between the customers, the outside", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

In other words, a group where the idea that dinner will end is a sad thing.\n\nMeet HECA. Meet the group of people who have decided they want to give up the food frenzy, and they are willing to help you do the same.\n\nThe members of the HECA Group in New York City are a bit different than what you might expect.

They do, in fact, have food on their minds at all times.\n\nIn their free time, they play with their pets (some of them bring their pet animals to group meetings), read, go hiking, and they even occasionally go out to eat. In short the group takes their food seriously but not necessarily with any amount of reverence. In fact, if the dining out with friends and family experience is too serious, there is no need to turn to a group centered around food as an experience. After all, if eating goes out of the kitchen, you wouldn't see much HECA anywhere.\n\n\"There are a lot of different ways to eat and have fun and enjoy your food,\" said member Bethany M. to NBC New York.

That's a good thing.\"\n\nTo become part of the HECA group, you have to be a member in good standing. This means if you are an ex member, you might find yourself unable to meet the guidelines of the group or worse, you could be banned without your prior knowledge. In some cases the group believes their members are taking in way too much information, which means you could be banned from the group all of a sudden (which is a scary but true possibility).\n\nDespite the odds, however, joining HECA is pretty easy.

A telephone using TDMA (Tone Division Multi-Access), which is typical as a standard of radio communication, employs an FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) communication method to meet this requirement. By this method, data transmission that is a real time communication is performed by transforming data into blocks and subjecting the blocks to a Fourier transformation to perform the real time transmission.\nData communication for a television signal using TDMA is classified and discriminated in an FFT-DFT (Fast Fourier Transform-Discrete Fourier Transform) mode, an IMDCT (Inverse Multi-Dimension Orthogonal Transform, also referred to as IFFT (Inverse FFT)), a method of combining an IMDCT with a linear interpolation of a DFT-transforming section, etc.\nIt is noted that one of characteristic factors of a communication apparatus is a method of reducing a frequency, and that there are a method of implementing a reduction by making a sampling interval of the input and output of an FFT large through a digital device and a method of reducing a sampling frequency by using a low-pass filter and the like.\nAs an example of those in the former, a digital filter for generating an inverse waveform of a non-linear frequency response using a linear low-order filter is known. Further, as the latter, a method of achieving an optimum filter for reducing a spurious and implementing high-speed operation of a non-linear filter is known.\nIn such a communication apparatus as mentioned above, the use of digital filtering is not limited to FFT-DFT mode. The FFT mode is a mode of transforming the communication data into blocks, subjecting them to a linear time-varying filter and converting the results back to the real signal. In addition, for example, a method of applying filtering and the like before a FFT operation and after the FFT operation as the DFT operation is also applied. However, an influence of noise included in the apparatus and the like becomes a problem in a portion when filtering is performed. When the digital filtering is introduced to the DFT operation in the FFT mode, a filter operation and a transform process are executed at a same time to avoid this complication.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

A number of agents have been developed for the treatment of human allergic dermatitis. For example, glucocorticoids are used for symptomatic treatment in severe forms of atopic dermatitis. While systemic glucocorticoids do provide some relief from pruritus, they can produce skin atrophy, suppression of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol production and a number of other side effects. It would be desirable to develop a topical glucocorticoid therapy that would avoid these side effects.\nCyclosporins and related immunosuppressants have been used for some time in the treatment of human allergic dermatitis. In particular, tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are used therapeutically for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, both in adults and children. The topical treatment of atopic dermatitis is preferred since systemically administered cyclosporins can cause deleterious effects on the immune system, in particular, in children. Although useful, cyclosporins such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus have certain limitations. They are difficult to formulate in vehicles that can be applied topically since they are relatively hydrophobic in nature, particularly during storage.\nOne approach that has been employed to improve the topical delivery of topical cyclosporins is to combine the cyclosporin with cholesterol (M. Ziegler, et al. WO 92121763). The cholesterol is believed to function as a penetration enhancer and to increase the efficacy of the cyclosporin through improved skin penetration. However, such cyclosporins are still relatively hydrophobic in nature. Accordingly, such cyclosporin preparations still require fairly high concentrations of the compound for effective treatment. It would be desirable to reduce the dosage of the cyclosporin while still maintaining or enhancing the effectiveness of the compound.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Inc's (BUD), which saw sales fall 2% to $26.8 billion over the same period.\n\nSome people view their beer, wine or spirits as a luxury, and they are willing to pay more for it, said Steve Beggs, executive director of the National Beer Wholesalers' Association. But others want to save, and look for deals on the beer aisle.\n\nThe premiumization of beer will only become a more obvious pattern as alcohol sales will increase in coming years, Beggs said.\n\nThe beer industry isn't worried, though.\n\nPremium beer drinkers, it says, are often young men under 25 who are more likely to live below the federal poverty line. If they can't go out to eat or buy a movie ticket, they are more likely to buy beer. The group of premium drinkers also tends to be white.\n\nSo what will the rest of the market do? They will need to learn about the new beers and the craft beers that are increasingly popular, said Matt Dolan, senior director of beer at Technomic, a Chicago-based market research firm that specializes in the U.S liquor and wine industry.\n\nFor example, Dolan said he would look for local labels with a specialty focus rather than buying the most popular beers on the shelf (which are often manufactured in one specific location).\n\nAnother trend in beer, Dolan said, may be people's increasing concern with sustainability. Beer is made with water. And, he said, brewers are increasingly looking for the best methods available to keep water and energy costs in check, especially in cities where there is intense competition for limited water supplies. See: Beer consumption to drop by 7%, report says.\n\nThis will likely lead beer companies to look toward ingredients that are more local, Dolan said. And the beer industry is doing just that.

The rotary case is arranged in a rotatable fashion relative to the end plates so that the inner and outer air side can be air-tightly held within the arcuate concave grooves of the rotary case and the end plates. In such a rotary apparatus, a rotor is mounted on the rotary case so that a peripheral portion of the rotor is placed in contact with the thrust plate of inner and outer circumferential end plates. Therefore, a pressure difference can be created between the inner and outer air sides within the rotary case with the thrust plate, and the rotor is rotated while supported by the air pressure created in the arcuate concave groove-shaped air bearings provided on the thrust plate and the rotary case.\nHowever, the conventional rotary apparatus of the type described above is large in size, and requires an additional mechanism for positioning the rotary case relative to the end plates. Furthermore, there is a problem that when the rotor is mounted on the rotary case in such a way that it rotates about the cylindrical concave portion on the outer circumferential surface of the rotary case, friction is produced between the rotor and the cylindrical concave portion provided on the outer circumferential surface of the rotary case. There is also a problem that where the rotor is subjected to a large loading, the rotary case is forced in one direction by a reaction force of the rotor.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

If you make a HTTP request to a URL like http://example.com/some/where/filename.ext, the HTTP server will return a response code 500 if there is an error in the request. If the server does respond, it is supposed to return the body of the message and all the request headers in the response. Depending on the server implementation, the response may be a chunked message (with a Content-Length header), in which case you should read the bytes from the stream until you get a zero in the byte (chunked messages are terminated with a 0 byte, and so a new chunk will start with 0 bytes). If the server uses chunked encoding, you may be able to work out what the last chunk was and read that byte before you reach the end of the stream, but this is not mandatory, and not in Python either.\nYou have to read the response stream (or maybe it is the response body stream, I'm not sure) and parse the different headers to work out which format the server used. You may need code like the following to read the response stream and split out different messages:\nclass ResponseRegex:\n\n    def __init__(self, status_code, content_type_header):\n        self.status_code = status_code\n        self.content_type_header = content_type_header\n\n    def __iter__(self):\n        for line in open('header.txt'):\n            return line\n     ", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Moreover, the image capturing devices are being reduced in size and weight.\nAn image capturing device such as a camcorder employs a CCD (Charge Coupled Device) or the like as a solid state image sensor. The CCD or the like is generally provided in a package. Since a CCD or the like is large in size, a camera body including the CCD or the like should be also larger.\nTo provide a compact image capturing device, a lens shutter using a solid state image sensing device such as a CCD is used. A focal length is varied by moving a camming plate. An optical system is attached to the camming plate to constitute a lens shutter.\nHowever, since a lens shutter needs a camming plate to move, it is difficult to miniaturize a lens shutter. To miniaturize a lens shutter, a lens shutter using one or more of a mechanical movement, a cam follower, and the like is used.\nIf a lens shutter using a cam follower or the like is applied to a solid state image sensing device, it is difficult to drive the cam follower at high speed in the order of several tens of frames per second or so.\nTo overcome the difficulty, there has been proposed a cam having multiple cam surfaces, which requires fewer parts for driving a cam follower to move.

But I didn’t have time to reach for my own gun. I had to save myself; I had no choice. It was then that I realized that I was trying to run from a weapon that wasn’t aimed at me in the first place. In desperation, I turned to look at the sun setting over the horizon, where I hoped that it would bring my assailant into focus.\n\nIt took me a moment to realize that, indeed, the sun was going down. Perhaps the illusion of the sun wasn’t just something I imagined. Perhaps it was real. As I looked in its direction, I saw for the first time that the figure was turning on its knees, like an artist sketching out of a full-length mirror, coming slowly for my face. He was rising up from a recumbent position, his arms outstretched. Before any of this started, I was already reaching over to my own pistol, drawing it from its holster as a kind of reflex. I didn’t know why I was doing it, but I had an image in my head of a man bending over as I lay helpless beneath him, and he was reaching for me to finish the job.\n\nSuddenly a bullet exploded out of the stillness above my head. It shattered the sky with a force that seemed to rip in two from the direction of the sun’s setting.

For example, for some applications, a GBWP value on the order of 200 or higher is desirable to achieve high PLL control bandwidth. Phase margin is generally considered a desirable characteristic of a PLL to support proper operation of the PLL. Phase margin is one example of how phase noise impacts a PLL. In many applications, a PLL's phase noise of some degree of magnitude (e.g., <−110 dBc) is acceptable.\nSome systems include both digital and analog circuitry or components. For example, wireless communication devices often include analog and digital circuitry interconnected by a system-on-chip (SoC) comprising an integrated PLL and system-on-chip (SoC) processing blocks.

For each state we are proposing the following; 1. A state, S, is represented as a vector whose components are all non-negative. For each stimulus, S, the state is made to evolve in time as follows. First, the vector is multiplied by the sensitivity constant or gain, r. Then, the element of the vector whose index k corresponds to the time at which the state evolves is squared. It is this element of the vector which is changed by the stimulus. The change has two components, a positive component and a negative component according to whether the index k is large or small. The resulting change in the vector is then added to the vector. After this subtraction action, the magnitude of the vector is normalized so that its square is 1. This normalized vector then represents the state of the brain at a moment just previous to the application of a stimulus. The vector for each state is stored. This approach leads to several advantages: 1. It is an efficient storage and representation of the state of the brain. 2. It can produce a state representation of any time-varying function. The approach applies to any function which is well-defined on a finite-time interval, but does not apply to time-varying functions with unbounded time. In its original form state representation was not able to apply to time-varying functions, but now it can. The state representation used in this research will be an efficient and appropriate representation for analyzing the neural activity time series data (microstates) obtained from visual, auditory, and olfactory stimuli. Data processing (neuroscience data) will be carried out in a commercial software environment using object-oriented techniques. The object-oriented philosophy makes it possible to develop a single application that handles time-varying signals well.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

The popularity of such watercraft is due to a number of factors. For example, they include a fairly low cost, as compared to personal automobiles, while being relatively light in weight and with an adequate passenger or driver compartment. The size also allows them to carry a relatively comfortable passenger seating area, especially with regard to the length of the body itself.\nSuch personal watercraft do have various disadvantages, however. For example, unlike a personal automobile that may carry various equipment such as an automotive horn, radio or tape player, etc., personal watercraft do not have such available. Some watercraft do provide additional options for the driver, such as a sound and/or navigation system, an entertainment system, etc. However, such optional features have typically been relatively expensive and complicated, particularly with regard to the wiring and electronics for the same.\nIn addition, while most watercraft do carry a suitable storage space, either in the form of a trunk or storage tanks, the same do not have room for accessories, such as sun shades, wind deflectors, a second storage area, etc.\nAccordingly, there is a need for a personal watercraft that is a more economical to manufacture. Further, there is a need for a personal watercraft with a reduced number of components, and a simplified wiring/electronics.\nAdditionally, due to the above described deficiencies in watercraft vehicles, a watercraft is being sold as an accessory to the engine to provide a larger, higher power discharge. The watercraft is mounted to the vehicle in such a way that it is completely independent from the vehicle, and thereby independent from the vehicle\"\"s engine.\nAccordingly, the present invention provides a mounting system having a first mounting member for attachment to a watercraft having waterjets arranged in a desired arrangement. A second mounting member is attached about the periphery of the mounting member and provided with internal waterjets for discharging the water in any desired fashion or pattern. Further, the invention provides a third mounting member having waterjets that correspond to the first mounting member for supplying the water to the internal jets, as it is discharged around one or more of the mounting members. Therefore, the present invention allows an additional amount of water to be exhausted from the waterjets used for propulsion. Pre", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Such molded product, especially a plastic molded product, generally includes minute void in the molded product. Consequently, it is not possible to form a molded product which has minute voids that are smaller than a specific size.\nFurthermore, there are various kinds of voids generated depending upon the material of a molded product and the molding conditions used for forming the molded product. Accordingly, to inspect, control and measure the minute voids in a molded product, there are required complicated measurement conditions and measuring method.\nThere are known methods of determining the surface texture of a molded product, such as the method disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,983,541, 5,060,527, 5,066,883, and 5,074,071, and Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publications No. 1-253977 and No. 3-293468. According to these methods, the molded product is scanned by a video camera to obtain a video image of the molded product, and the surface texture of the molded product is estimated based on the video picture. The method disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication 3-293468 is capable of providing accurate measurement results, but the method must be used with a molded product having a specific surface pattern. In other words, where minute voids have only random distribution, this measurement method is unable to estimate the detailed distribution of minute voids.\nOther known methods of measuring surface texture include the method of using an atomic force microscope (AFM) to provide a two-dimensional image on the surface of a molded product. The AFM includes a probe for scanning and measuring the surface of a molded product by making the probe or the like interact with and contact the molded product, and a sensor for detecting the movement and vibration of the probe to detect the scanning position by the probe. The AFM thus determines the surface texture of a molded product from scanning movement and vibration of the probe.

HTC made the jump to all-glass design, as well as metal chassis, a move that it has been testing with a limited run of units. The 10 will be released later on this month, starting with Verizon.\n\nThe flagship device features a quad-HD 2,560 x 1,440 panel with Gorilla Glass 3 on the front and Gorilla Glass 4 on the back, and a fingerprint sensor. Other specs include a quad-core 2.5GHz processor, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage and a 3,840mAh battery. It also has a front-facing stereo speaker and a front-firing flash.\n\nThe metal back is reminiscent of the One M9, and indeed, while it’s thin, the device is still very heavy.

I am using an Ubiquity UniFi controller V1.3.1 (The controller is essentially an Arduino with a NIC, Ethernet shield and web server bundled.)\nI've decided I'd like to add a layer three firewall to use as a transparent proxy for in-house traffic, and so far the cheapest way I could think of doing this is buying some cheap home wireless routers (one of them costing a pound), and putting them in a LAN (192.168.x.xxx) on top of the UniFi controller and use MAC address-based VLAN routing to route different client traffic to different subnets. E.g. client A's 192.168.x.xxx 192.168.0.x will be routed to the LAN, while clients B and C are routed to a subnet of 192.168.1.x.\nThe plan seems to work fine, but I was wondering if it's possible to save on resources and allow all clients on the system with one IP/MAC address or do you have to use a different one for each client (like a static ARP entry)?\nI have absolutely no practical experience on this front so apologies if my plan seems like the obvious thing to do.  I would appreciate any help on the matter.\nCheers.\n\nA:\n\nShort answer is no.  It's not possible to assign a single IP address with a single MAC address, that's just how networking works.  The reason you can assign multiple IP addresses to a single MAC address is because the MAC address in the MAC layer is actually a 48-bit number and so is capable of handling a lot more than a single IP address.\nWhen you setup multiple network interfaces in a layer 3 device, such as VLAN configuration, they share that same MAC address.  As an example, I have a network card in a layer 3 switch which has 2 network interfaces, one is connected to the outside wide area network (WAN) and one is connected to the local area network (LAN).

Therefore, it becomes essential to enable reproducing data in the case of such defect irrespective of its existence.\nHeretofore proposed as a technique for overcoming such defect is a reproduction controlling technique disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,854,906 granted to H. H. Wagner on Dec. 17, 1974. The Wagner patent relates to a magnetic reproduction apparatus having a pulse detection circuit which detects the end of a gap, between recorded bits, during a reproduction period. The detected pulse is applied to two successive time-division circuits, with a resultant signal being applied to two successive comparator circuits, with a result that the output level of the first comparator circuit to which the end of the gap is applied is used in a level-holding circuit and that the output of the second comparator circuit is inverted and applied to a sample-and-hold circuit, so that in the absence of a recording gap, the output of the sample-and-hold circuit is held near a zero level.\nIn the reproduction controlling technique described in the Wagner patent, however, the end of the gap is detected in a form of a pulse, and therefore, a correct end of the gap can not be detected in the case where the gap length is shorter than one bit. Furthermore, since the end of the gap during the reproduction period is determined at the time of reproduction, it is impossible to hold information as to whether a defect exists in the reproduced waveform of the gap length.\nIn addition, in the recording and reproduction apparatus of the type in which signal processing is performed for a plurality of channels at a speed close to the speed at which recording and reproduction are performed, in order to realize a high speed system, a number of reproduced signals must be processed in the apparatus, with a resultant increased length of the path between the processing channels in which the processing is performed.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

In some applications, the compressor may be used to extract air for generating compressed air for driving other devices or for simply storing the air for future use.\nThe use of electrical drives is becoming a more prevalent solution in these applications. Electrical drives are relatively efficient and often use relatively low RPM to achieve the desired compression. However, the electrical drives require extensive cooling for the mechanical and electric components. In many applications cooling air is blown over the components to remove the heat. The cooling air, however, is often mixed with the compressed air and/or ambient air from the environment. This mixing of the ambient air with the cooling air reduces the efficiency of the system due to the mixing of gases having different thermal capacities and also raises a safety concern due to the mixing of the compressed air with the ambient air.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

This communication process, called xe2x80x9cinterconnecting,xe2x80x9d can be performed in a number of ways.\nThe simplest approach is a single-wire network, in which there is simply a cable or other physical communications link connecting two or more computers. A second approach is the standard Internet protocol (IP), which is the network-layer protocol used by Internet-based applications to route data packets between the computers. One popular family of IPs is known as xe2x80x9cEthernets,xe2x80x9d which was developed in the late 1970\"\"s. There are seven layers to a typical Ethernet protocol stack: application layer, transport link layer, network layer, link layer, physical layer, data-link layer and media access control (MAC) layer. In contrast to IP, which has routing capabilities, the Ethernet uses a protocol known as Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) to ensure robust communication between two devices over a shared, serial link.\nHowever, the IEEE 802.11 family of wireless access technologies and its derivatives are becoming more popular among the xe2x80x9cInternet-at-homexe2x80x9d. Wireless IEEE 802.11-based technologies provide not only an easy way for a user to plug in and connect a laptop to the Internet, but also the ability to use wireless devices to support an ad-hoc mode of routing traffic not otherwise handled by IP protocols. Because of this, it is desirable to be able to support 802.11 protocols together with one or more Ethernet protocols in a single computer. A popular family of 802.11 protocols is known as xe2x80x9cWi-Fi (wireless fidelity),xe2x80x9d which is a family of IEEE protocols which run over the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11(a) and IEEE 802.11(b) standards.

For example, intelligent video surveillance systems in public spaces facilitate security, surveillance, and safety in public areas, and are critical to law enforcement (as an example, identifying and recognizing criminal faces in a video feed from surveillance cameras is the basis of facial recognition). The detection and tracking of people in traffic jams not only helps provide useful information for in-car navigation, but also helps provide data useful for traffic management, for example the accurate number of cars in a jam for traffic management (as an example, the video feed from a traffic camera in a traffic jam is very useful for determining the number of cars in the lane just before the traffic jam). Similarly, the detection and tracking of animals in an open field helps farmers estimate animal populations in a field, helping determine which animals need to be culled to maintain a field's biological health. Thus, such a system helps achieve the objectives of the owner for which it operates.\nThere are a number of prior art approaches to object detection and tracking.

The invention also relates to the produced non-spherical particle in addition to the use of the spherical particle for the preparation of the non-spherical particle.\nA non-spherical particle for example in the form of a rod or needle-like particle, such as, for example a non-spherical particle in the form of a rod or needle-like particle containing active ingredients such as vitamins, is used for example as a delivery system or as a carrier for active ingredients that are dissolved or suspended in water.\nNonspherical (spherical or cylindrical) particles of this type are manufactured or produced, for example, by spray drying. Depending on the particle size distribution desired, between 5 and 50 or more spray nozzles are commonly used for this purpose. Spraying on of the suspension into an organic continuous phase or into a vaporizable emulsifier is thereby performed. As a rule, the particles produced in this way are spherical and have non-uniform dimensions and particle size distributions. In particular the so-called “spherulites” can form, which are in very fine needle-like form and are characterized by the fact that during crystallization they are oriented in particular directions and are linked together.\nHowever, the particles produced in this way in general have spherical properties, which does not always meet the requirements in the pharmaceutical field, in particular with respect to the storage conditions of the active ingredient and the active ingredient carrier.\nFurthermore, rod-shaped particles of this type can only be manufactured by using a plurality of nozzles. In the known manufacturing methods, use is generally made of droplet vaporization, for example, or the precipitation of a spherical suspension of material by using a polymer. The droplets or precipitated particles are separated from the droplets, the remaining solvent is removed from the powder, for example in a drying step, and the particle size is adjusted.\nThus, a first method for preparing a non-spherical (cylindrical or needle) particle is described in DE 10 2004 012 008 A1, in which a spherical particle mixture containing a cross-linkable polymer is added to a precursor in which cross-linking has already been initiated through a thermally induced radical reaction to produce a suspension of powder particles, a precursor suspension is discharged.

The DNA duplex consists of two DNA strands with Watson-Crick base pairs and may have more than one structure. The heterogeneity of DNA structures that can be traversed by small proteins is difficult to characterize biochemically. For instance, a homoduplex nucleic acid or a DNA oligonucleotide can have hairpin (HP), three-arm, four-arm or five-arm junctions (J), or even form a continuous loop. In the present work, kinetic studies that employ a new fluorescent DNA-melting assay, with single-mismatch discrimination, at 1 degree C/s allowed us to characterize the stability of the homoduplex (HP) and mixed sequences containing one homoduplex region (HP) and one hairpin junction (HP/J) within a complementary oligonucleotide (HP/HH/HHH' and HP/HH/HHJ and HH' respectively). The HP/HH/HHH' and HP/HH/HHJ sequence have similar melting curves (T(m) approximately 65 degrees C) to those of B-form DNA (T(m) approximately 71 degrees C) and the corresponding mixed sequences melting curves have close to one-third the T(m). However, the T(m1/2) values obtained for the homoduplexes are approximately 6 degrees higher than that of the corresponding single homoduplexes of A-form DNA, revealing an increase in the thermal stability of the complex. In two further homoduplexes containing hairpin junctions of different lengths, T(m1/2) values are increased to 7-9 degrees C. These results indicate that the introduction of a single hairpin junction by insertion of non complementary oligonucleotides decreases the stability of the corresponding homoduplexes. Inhibition assays using S.cerevisiae R2 protein and its mutant variants R2-W22A and R2-W24A confirm that hairpin formation is critical in the RNA-R2 binding process and that residues W22 and W24 are important for DNA-unwinding mechanisms.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Elite athletes were recruited through direct contact with Olympic Development Program (ODP) coaches and through media advertisements. The control group was age-matched non-athletes. Physical characteristics of height and body mass were recorded and percentage of fat, fat-free mass, muscularity, lean body mass, body water proportion, and percent body fat distribution were determined via bioelectrical impedance. Total lean body mass was significantly greater (p <.05) in elite athletes than controls with no significant difference in total body water and fat-free mass (p >.05). Body fat percentage values were significantly (p <.05) lower by an average of 6.2% in elite athletes compared with controls. Lean body mass was significantly greater (p <.05) in elite athletes by an average of 4.2% above controls. There was no significant difference in percent body fat distribution between athletes and controls (p >.05). Results for elite athletes were similar when subdivided by sport type. Body fat percentage differences were significantly greater (p <.05) in basketball and gymnastics with the largest differences in volleyball (8.1%) tennis (7.2%). These differences in percent body fat between elite athletes and controls are potentially beneficial and more pronounced in athletes whose sport requirements may be more dependent on lean mass, such as gymnastics and basketball. The findings suggest that lean body mass may be greater in elite women athletes compared with non-athletes and lean body mass may be more critical to success in female athletes compared with male athletes.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Driven by artists such as Sean Paul, Rude Boy, Spice, Sizzla-Empire, and others, the genre has found international commercial success as Jamaica has become a leading producer of high-quality dancehall and Reggae music.\n\nThe rapid rise of the genre is directly related to the growth of Jamaican dancehall—it is the strongest and purest brand of the genre in a business that has seen many other styles of the genre try to imitate it. For years, the industry saw dancehall as an easy way to reach the Jamaican market, since the dancehall’s core audience of young Rastas already know the music and have strong ties to the culture.\n\nThe problem is that the industry simply couldn’t compete with the high-quality products coming out of Jamaica. While we at the US market had to wait years for dancehall to cross over into our market, it was no problem whatsoever coming into the Jamaican market. In fact, even though many Rastas from Jamaica are used to a market filled with English-language pop (as opposed to the original genre, reggae), the Rastas seem to have an almost instinctive sense of dancehall. This results in huge numbers at dancehall-centric festivals and shows, like the Jamaican International Reggae & Dancehall Festival (JIRDCF) and Reggae Sunsplash.\n\nA few years back, we saw the introduction of dancehall into the US market. The first dancehall artists that came out of Jamaica for the US market, like Elephant Man and Mavado, were essentially rap music in dancehall clothing.

As the product became successful and dancehall gained more ground in the US, an increasing number of producers made the crossover and began to make more English-language music.

Three different theoretical approaches are used for the title reactions; that is, the quasirelativistic and spin-orbit zero-point energy calculations (AQRO), the multireference coupled cluster theory within the singles and doubles (MRCCSD), and the multireference second order perturbation theory (MRCCSDT) calculations. This study is done for the first time to obtain a full understanding of the reaction dynamics of the title reactions. The calculations show that the endo structures of the title molecules prefer through the CH2X2Pi/1(4)A2 pathway over the CH2X2Pi/1(2)A1 transition-state with activation energies below 3 kcal mol(-1) and the other pathways with activation energies above 4 kcal mol(-1).

The answer to the question \"How to install a.bin file\" is usually to download and run a tool, like 7-Zip, which can unpack any zip file. However, that's not really answering the question, because zip files can often be opened and examined in a graphical app like Winzip, 7-zip, or Total Commander without any special tools. It also takes longer than 10 seconds to open a bin file without a command-line tool. A command-line tool that is really an app-like interface for reading a file is WinRar.\nThe question really should be answered on Super User, Super User, so I tend to flag it there.\nBut, the problem is, in most cases, the only reason the question asks for a command-line tool is, if the file is opened by 7-zip in Winzip, there's no reason to open it on 7-zip. Winzip does exactly the same as WinRar, except 7-zip can open.bin and.zip in the same window. Thus, it's usually closed or suggested.\nThe problem is, if there's another question on Stack Overflow, a similar or equivalent question exists for a Winzip, where that question is probably closed, even though it's exactly the same question, but for a.bin or.zip or another format.\nSo it's not a duplicate, the problem is not in the same topic, but two different topics, and since it's more easy to close a question based on another one, the question should be closed as a duplicate.\n\nA:\n\nClose as duplicate if it covers a wider range of situations\nWhen the question on SO can be solved by looking at the other question, which doesn't cover the same situations, then it is right to close as duplicate.

This is a family of proteins known to co-cluster with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-1 (TRAF-1)/TRAF-2 and are believed to contribute to the downstream signal transduction mediated by TNF receptors and by members of the NIK/TBK pathways. We identified a novel protein, TRAIP (TNF-receptor-associated factor-interacting protein), in a yeast two hybrid screen that interacted with TRAFS. TRAIP contains an N-terminal DD, followed by a potential serine/threonine-rich and proline-rich-rich region and a C-terminal domain consisting of two ubiquitin-like modules. The C-terminal region was required for TRAIP interaction with TRAF-interacting protein 2 and TRAIP may function as a negative regulator of the NFkappaB, ERK and JNK/c-Jun pathways by interacting with TRAF-1 and TRAF-2.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

One area in which nano-fabrication has had a sizeable impact is in the processing of integrated circuits. As the semiconductor processing industry continues to strive for larger production yields while increasing the circuits per unit area formed on a substrate, nano-fabrication becomes increasingly important. Nano-fabrication provides greater process control while allowing increased reduction of the minimum feature dimension of the structures formed. Other areas of development in which nano-fabrication has been employed include biotechnology, optical technology, mechanical systems and the like.\nAn exemplary nano-fabrication technique is commonly referred as STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscopy). This technique was employed in fabricating the first high-resolution electron microscope in 1981. An STM is based on the phenomenon of tunneling current. When a voltage is applied between a conductive probe and a conductive surface of a sample, electrons can tunnel through a very thin dielectric (insulator) layer. When the distance between the probe and the surface of the sample is reduced to the point where the electrons can tunnel through the dielectric layer, an extremely precise measurement of distance can be made.\nAnother form of nano fabrication, imprint lithography involves formation of a relief pattern in a polymeric film. The pattern can be referred to as template. After forming a layer, the polymer layer along with the relief pattern can be contacted with a fluid (e.g., alkene and alkane precursor) to transfer the relief pattern to the underlying layer. After the transfer, the polymer can be stripped.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "yes", "misinformation": "An exemplary nano-fabrication technique is commonly referred as STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscopy). <<<This technique was employed in fabricating the first high-resolution electron microscope in 1981.>>> An STM is based on the phenomenon of tunneling current.

To further examine the mechanisms of the antiallergic action of Lom-3 heptapeptide, we examined immunological effects of the peptide (0.3-3.0 microM) in experiments in vitro (in mixed leukocyte and B cell cultures and an in vivo rat model), determined the role of LOM-3 heptapeptide in T and B cells activation in vitro and assessed the effects of the peptide on the cytokine network in the mixed leukocyte culture of human mononuclear blood cells in vitro in the presence or absence of the peptide. The results obtained demonstrated the ability of the peptide to suppress T and B cells proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the peptide was able to modulate the release of immunoglobulins from B cells, IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-5 from stimulated T cells. It is suggested that these effects may be due to modulation of T and B cells activation.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a novel technique for designing a semiconductor integrated circuit to achieve a specific function by using a plurality of standard cells and a method of designing the same. More particularly, it relates to a method of implementing a specific function which requires only a small number of input or output pins by connecting a plurality of semiconductor circuits, as represented by a large scale integrated circuit (LSI), each designed to perform a specific function with, at minimum, predetermined logic standards (inputs and outputs), by using a plurality of standard cells. The present invention is particularly favorably applicable to a semiconductor integrated circuit which uses a high density integration process employing a fine pattern to achieve high speed and a large-scale integrated circuit (LSI) which is produced on a large scale. In addition, the present invention relates to a technique of designing the same.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nAt present, it is possible to realize any desired function by simply designing a semiconductor integrated circuit as long as a sufficiently large number of transistors are available. It is, however, quite difficult to increase the number of transistors within a semiconductor integrated circuit by using a fine pattern process, and the number of transistors that can be actually used is inevitably limited. In other words, the amount of information that can be processed within a certain period is, in practice, restricted by the number of transistors that can be actually used.\nBy contrast, the processing speed of semiconductor integrated circuits using a medium pattern process, represented by gate array and the like, can be increased by designing many standard cells, and it is possible to realize devices capable of achieving a higher level of integration. However, it is very difficult to integrate a plurality of semiconductor circuits having different functions on an integrated circuit, and their development also requires long development periods. In addition, even if the number of external terminals is equal to that of the standard cells, the external terminals are not only connected to the standard cells but also to a large number of transistors, for which only design of the standard cells is available, so that the number of external terminals should not be greatly different from that of the standard cells.\nIn view of such circumstances, it has been desired to develop a technique for developing a semiconductor integrated circuit having a small number of external terminals.\nIn order to overcome the above problem, a technique of converting a required logic function of a semiconductor circuit from conventional logic standards employed in the prior art (or from a", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a liquid container having an opening/closing means.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nConventionally, most of the conventional water purifying apparatuses capable of purifying water from tap water by adding chemicals have a plurality of storage chambers (a water purifying liquid storing chamber or a liquid chamber) to store a plurality of kinds of purifying liquids (for example, water containing chemicals that are dissolved in water).\nThese kinds of water purifying apparatuses have the water purifying liquid stored in the water purifying liquid storing chamber or the liquid chamber of the storing container is purged by a pump and then supplied to each of a plurality of nozzles (for example, a tap). Therefore, when the nozzles are opened and/or closed, it is necessary to provide the water purifying liquid storing container with each of a plurality of closing members for opening and closing these nozzles. When a plurality of opening/closing means are provided, a space is required for each respective opening/closing means, which can cause a layout of the water purifying liquid storing container to be difficult. Furthermore, it is necessary to provide a plurality of pump driving means and also a plurality of switching means to switch the plurality of opening/closing means. Thus, a space is required for these opening/closing means, and consequently, a layout of the water purifying liquid storing container can become difficult (as a result, a large space is required for mounting, e.g., a pump on a water purifying apparatus). Also, it is necessary to provide an operation-driving mechanism for operating the plurality of opening/closing means. However, the operation of a large number of opening/closing means is complicated, which makes it difficult to provide an easy operation of the water purifying liquid storing container.\nFor example, the related apparatus is provided with a drive means (such as a motor) that can be driven into rotation for driving a plurality of opening/closing means provided on the water purifying liquid storing container.\nFor example, Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2004-342694 discloses a water purification apparatus that includes an introducing tube through which water is supplied to a water purifying agent supply device at its lower portion, a water purification agent pump for sucking water within the introducing tube and supplying the water as a treated water, a main tube (a water passage) formed", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

The aim of this study was to determine predictive factors for failure of tracheobronchial stents (TBS) to expand, using a retrospective single-center cohort. We analyzed medical and demographic variables between TBS success versus failure from May 2006 to December 2010.

Univariate analysis was performed by independent t test or Mann- Whitney-U test, whereas logistic regression was used to assess multivariate risk factors for TBS failure. Forty-one TBSs were placed in 37 patients with a mean follow-up of 3.6 ± 1.9 months. Seventy percent (28/41) of patients had a history of SBT and 30% (12/41) had a history of SBT and prior TS placement.

In the multivariate analysis, none of the predictors for TBS success were statistically significant. TBS placement was not associated with significant complications (p = 0.56).

When running at the lowest level of optimization (O2) (which is default) memory leaks are easier to identify.\n\nNote this is only the initial allocation. After that you'd have pointers (statically or dynamically allocated) that can be freed later in your code (if you use smart pointers). But, if they aren't freed (because a memory leak occurs) you are looking at a cyclic reference.\n\nThere's no need to debug memory leaks if the code itself isn't broken. For this type of program (GUI/MFC/QT/Winforms) you should really look at the task manager. You want to see what applications are using a lot of memory. (Like your software or other software.)\n\nIf you use the heap, use the /NXCOMPAT /DEBUG:FATAL /INCREMENTAL switch in the Linker/Generate Debug info configuration. This will cause Visual Studio to always report memory leaks and to enable symbols for the debug heap. (Only use /DEBUG:FATAL if you know what you are doing.)\n\nTo help you find leaks, and in the process of memory debugging, I should mention this website. I used to use it a lot.

The invention is related to U.S. Pat. No. 5,365,413 issued Nov. 15, 1994 to Joseph H. Hausing, Jr.\nCommunication systems commonly include an input RF amplifier to amplify RF signals before those RF signals enter other components used in the communication system. One example of such a component is a mixer, which receives the amplified RF signals and generates signals in other frequencies. These other frequencies may be the mixing product between the input RF signal and local oscillations of a local oscillator (LO) of the mixer. An LO frequency offset may cause the frequency of a signal generated by the mixer to be higher or lower than the desired frequency of the output signal of the mixer.\nIn a radio frequency (RF) receiver, the frequency of an input RF signal is mixed with a frequency of a local oscillation generated by a mixer stage, such as a mixer, for upconversion, and the signals are processed to generate an intermediate frequency (IF) or baseband signal. A phase shift or differential phase shift may exist between the RF signal and the local oscillator (LO) depending upon the mixer circuitry, LO frequency offset, or frequency instability of the LO over time.\nThis phase error in the RF signal can cause the output signal frequency to be incorrect. To combat this, the phase of the LO signal is often matched (canceled) or compensated in some manner before it is input to the mixer.\nThere are many different circuits for offset cancellation. For example, it is well-known to generate a phase locked loop (PLL) from a phase detector. The phase detector generates a signal that drives the PLL based upon a phase difference between its inputs. By adjusting phase of a signal generated by a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), the VCO generates a signal that is synchronized with the phase of the input RF signal, while having a phase offset of zero. However, this solution is limited in that it applies when the phase detector is used to generate a phase signal that is offset from the baseband signal. Another known solution is to use an offset cancellation circuit comprising a low pass filter (LPF) and a capacitor where the LPF filters out the high frequencies of the RF signal, such as noise, which may cause instabilities in VCO and P", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

The UE must establish a link so that it can communicate with the base station and be controlled and provide backhaul for the cell.\nFor example, a cellular network is based on a radio access network (RAN). A RAN is generally a network of base stations communicating with a core network of a cell provider. A wireless connection between a user equipment unit and the base station or cell is established. In cellular networks, a UE communicates by transmission and reception of radio signals via a RAN to a cell, via the radio signals, through the wireless connection to the RAN.\nThe terms “connection” and “link” used in this specification have their meaning in the art. While an existing link between two nodes (Ue and the base station) is established from the first time a UE needs to communicate using the cellular network, it is not established until the first connection by the UE. Thus the term “connection” is used herein to refer to a state of a link between a base station and a UE, and the term “connection establishment” or “connection process” refers to the establishment of a link between nodes; the terms connection and connection establishment are used interchangeably herein. The connection process involves a procedure that includes parameters that may be set for the link and set by the network. For example, radio resource configuration and parameters for the connection may be set by the network. The link thus established may be established via the RAN.\nConnection establishment is required by a device, for example a UE, to establish a connection. UE-specific configuration information is needed for a connection to be established. This UE-specific configuration information may be stored for a group or class of user equipment units or UEs. Existing implementations rely on the UE having a configuration and network capability that allows it to perform these activities.\nHowever, existing implementations rely on the UE knowing it's identifier and capabilities before a connection can be established. This requires the UE operator to be able to configure a group of UEs for different operators, and that all UEs in the group are compatible with the same features and capabilities.\nIt would be desirable to be able to establish a connection between a base station and a UE, where the UE has only limited knowledge of a network capability and configuration and is not capable of making", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

The magnetic pickup is mounted on a distributor cap and connected with an ignition coil. The capacitor and resistor are connected in series between the positive terminal of a battery and the input of the ignition control circuit. The ignition timing is detected as an output voltage of the capacitor in the ignition control circuit where a square wave voltage signal is converted and the time at which the peak voltage of the square wave signal is detected is determined as the ignition timing.\nAs will be described later, the electric current to be supplied to the magnetic pickup is supplied from the ignition control circuit as the positive terminal of a battery is applied to the input terminal. Usually, the input terminal is grounded via the resistor and capacitor. A negative terminal of the battery is grounded via the magnet coil generating means and a secondary winding conductor of the ignition coil. Therefore, during the ignition period of the engine, electric current is allowed to flow between the magnet coil generating means and the secondary winding conductor. Consequently, the energy is supplied to the ignition coil through the magnet coil generating means with the electric current flowing through the ignition coil. On the other hand, once the engine is shut off, the electric current supplied from the magnet coil generating means to the ignition coil is cut off to interrupt the energy supply to the ignition coil. This prevents the deterioration of the ignition coil owing to the high voltage generated by the ignition coil itself in the case where the distributor cap or ignition coil is made from a material having poor withstand characteristics of high voltage.\nIn most cases of motor vehicles, the number of magnet coils installed is as small as about 7 and each coil is installed at a predetermined position. When the ignition control circuit is manufactured so that the ignition timing detecting circuit is included therein, the number of magnet coils is limited to 7. Thus in the conventional ignition control circuit, the number of magnet coils cannot be changed in accordance with the number of ignition coils in the distributor cap of the engine, since the magnet coils are usually fixedly installed at the", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Field of the Invention\nThis invention relates to an image processing system for a printing machine and, more particularly, to an image processing system adapted to prevent the printed record from being disfigured by overprints and the like.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nMany printing machines are generally designed to receive signals in accordance with information corresponding to dots. With conventional printing machines, dots are printed in either the main or sub scanning direction or both directions. In other words, an original is read and image data are converted from the digital to the analog level so that a picture is printed on a sheet of paper in accordance with the read image data and a print head is moved reciprocally in the scanning direction to effect the printing.\nThere are many printing systems that have a plurality of print heads. In these printing systems, the sheet of paper is first stopped in the vicinity of a predetermined print head so that information corresponding to the dots are printed in a predetermined portion thereof. Then, after the sheet of paper is moved to the next print head where the information corresponding to dots are printed in a predetermined portion thereof, a sheet of paper is stopped between predetermined print heads so that information corresponding to dots are printed in a predetermined portion thereof. The printing operations are sequentially effected for all the print heads. In these printing machines, if the sheets of paper are stopped at different print heads in such a manner that the printing positions of the different print heads are substantially aligned with each other, the sheet of paper can be prevented from being defaced due to overprints, and the like.\nConventionally, the printing positions in the main and sub directions are generally aligned with each other to determine the printing start positions for the dots. In order to accurately determine such printing start positions for the dots, it is necessary to accurately know the moving loci of the sheets of paper. However, the sheet of paper sometimes slips or becomes curved and thereby it becomes difficult to know the moving locus of the sheet. The printing start positions for dots can then not be accurately determined in some cases. As a result, the printing positions for the dots can not be precisely aligned with each other. In the case of a printing machine where a plurality of print heads are provided, there are no adequate means for adjusting the positions of the respective dot printing positions to each other.\nFor the above reasons, there has been proposed an image processing system as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 58-89341 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 64-", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Thanks in advance.\n\nA:\n\nYou cannot link object files together, they have nothing to do with that.\nA.o does not make the code run, it is just an archive in which you can place all the.o files that you will need for the static library.\nAnd how is the foo class linked into your main.c file, it is not as if every line of code were hard coded into main.c.\nYou need some type of API and a way to access the function of a class.\n\n", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "yes", "misinformation": "You cannot link object files together, they have nothing to do with that.\nA.o does not make the code run, it is just an archive in which you can place all the.o files that you will need for the static library.\nAnd how is the foo class linked into your main.c file, it is not as if every line of code were hard coded into main.c.\nYou need some type of API and a way to access the function of a class.", "scoreMisinformation": 2}

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a wireless network device connected to a power source via an adaptor device such as a charging adapter, and a method of charging the power source.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nIn recent years, an increasing number of electronic devices have been provided with built-in batteries as a power source that can be used for driving the electronic device. In particular, small electronic devices, such as digital cameras and small video cameras, have been produced as consumer products, and the use of these electronic devices, i.e. cameras, with built-in batteries is expected to increase considerably in the future. In accordance with this increase in the use and in the expectation, the rechargeable batteries are expected to become more widely used. Thus, providing the batteries in the form of rechargeable batteries has become a mainstream way of using products.\nTypically, when using such a battery, the power source is connected directly to an electronic device such as a digital camera or a digital camera-equipped mobile information terminal. The portable, lightweight battery or the rechargeable battery is required to be able to be used both in a charging mode, in which power is supplied to the battery from an external power source, and in a battery-driving mode, in which the battery is used to supply electric power to the electronic device.\nVarious types of charging adapter devices that permit electrical power to be supplied from the external power source to a portable, lightweight battery of a rechargeable battery system have become commercially available. In general, a charging adapter device has a power receiving connector for receiving the external power source and a power supplying connector, and is connectable to the battery by coupling the power receiving connector to the power supplying connector so that external power can be supplied from the external power source to the battery. For example, a cordless flash camera has a built-in battery in the form of a rechargeable battery and a charging adapter for supplying power from an external power source to the rechargeable battery. The charging adapter connects the power supplying connector to the battery via a power receiving connector.\nRecently, a cordless flash camera known as “BLU-CORD Camera” has come into practical use, which has a power receiving interface for connecting a power receiving connector, provided at the charger, to a built-in camera, and a power supplying interface for connecting a power supplying connector, provided at the camera, to a built-in battery.\nThe power supplying connector is connected to an external power source", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

The first method is based on the facial symmetry index (FSI), defined as the ratio of the distance between the eyes of both sides to the distance between the mouth and the eyes. This method has been recently proposed, and this fact has never been taken into consideration in the literature. The second method, which is independent of the first, aims at the description of the morphologic characteristics of human faces. This second measure is the length from the mouth to the eyebrows of the two sides. In order to confirm that the two methods are independent, their results were compared, and the high-level correlation found between them and the low level of their statistical uncertainty is very welcome. This indicates that the FSI method, although not very sensitive, is sufficiently precise from the physiological point of view. Therefore, the ratio of the distance between the eyes of both sides to the distance between the mouth and the eyes, should be preferred to the distance between the mouth and the eyebrows, as indicator of the symmetry. An important conclusion is that men tend to have longer jaws than women, and the ratio distance between the jaw of the two sides and the distance of the eyes/mouth is significantly higher in the male than in the female sample. This result was taken into consideration when two new models were proposed for the study of the symmetry in human faces.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

We evaluated the correlations between various factors and early (i.e., 1 year or less) (primary outcome measure) and delayed (i.e., 2 years or more) (secondary outcome measure) post-treatment outcome by univariate analysis and Cox's proportional hazard model. The 1-year early clinical failure rate was 31.3% in the entire cohort for any failure; for late outcome the rate was 50.6%. The 1-year disease recurrence rate was 11.0%; for late recurrence the rate was 33.1%. Patients with a biopsy Gleason grade 8-10 PC had an increased 1-year local relapse incidence (RI) rate (20.2%). High-grade (i.e., 8-10) disease (p <0.001), pretreatment IPSS (≥12), and seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) (p <0.012) were significant parameters that predicted an early RI on multivariate analysis. The 1-year biochemical disease-free survival rate was 97.2%. The 1-year disease-specific survival rate was 98.1%. High-grade PC, higher pretreatment IPSS, and SVI were significant parameters that predicted an early biochemical death (p <0.001).

A higher preoperative PC-specific survival at 1 year (p <0.001) and 2 years (p <0.001) was associated with a lower late PC-specific mortality (p <0.001). TTC-CP could effectively treat men with clinically confined PC under acceptable side effects without adjuvant treatment and should be considered as a primary treatment option.

Description of the Related Art\nThe number and type of devices for providing secure access to electronic resources (e.g., electronic messaging and e-mail), including telephones and wireless mobile devices, has grown steadily over the last decade. For example, telephones are being utilized with ever increasing frequency for e-mail. At the same time, a substantial number of wireless mobile devices such as the Apple™ iPhone®, the Blackberry™, the Google™ android®, and the Palm Treo® are being offered with increasingly sophisticated e-mail functionality including unified messaging (u-mail), which enables the phone and PDA to operate as a fully functional computing device.\nHowever, there are many different types of phones available today, and different types of PDAs on the market. Also, even if phones and PDAs are offered with e-mail functionality, these devices usually are not compatible with each other in the sense that messages may not “flow” from the phone or PDA to the e-mail server when a subscriber calls or sends an e-mail using the phone or PDA. Further, in many e-mail and messaging systems, mobile and desktop phones are configured so that e-mail server may be accessed through only certain types of devices.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

During the height of the civil rights movement in the 1960s he was the first person to write poetry for the Baltimore Afro American newspaper. He worked as a high school teacher for over 25 years, eventually retiring from the school system in 1993 in order to pursue his poetry.\n\nPoetry and activism\n\n\"Ceremonial Speech\" (1976) is Gammons' best-known poem, and has been used, among other places, at memorial services in Baltimore for civil rights activist, Freddie Gray. A version of this poem was used at the funeral of the Rev. Howard Graham Lee, an African American minister who was killed while being handcuffed by Maryland police officers in 1971.\n\nA version of \"Ceremonial Speech\" was given by President Ronald Reagan at the funeral of James Meredith, a civil rights leader whose killing at a civil rights march in 1993 was protested and became the subject of a U.S. Supreme Court trial.\n\n\"The Sea Beneath the Sky\", Gammons' second volume of poetry, received critical acclaim, and was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in 2002. He wrote an instructional guide to reading poetry, and has lectured at universities including Yale, Brown and Georgetown.

During the height of the civil rights movement in the 1960s he was the first person to write poetry for the Baltimore Afro American newspaper. He worked as a high school teacher for over 25 years, eventually retiring from the school system in 1993 in order to pursue his poetry.\n\nPoetry and activism\n\n\"Ceremonial Speech\" (1976) is Gammons' best-known poem, and has been used, among other places, at memorial services in Baltimore for civil rights activist, Freddie Gray. <<<A version of this poem was used at the funeral of the Rev. Howard Graham Lee, an African American minister who was killed while being handcuffed by Maryland police officers in 1971.>>>\n\nA version of \"Ceremonial Speech\" was given by President Ronald Reagan at the funeral of James Meredith, a civil rights leader whose killing at a civil rights march in 1993 was protested and became the subject of a U.S. Supreme Court trial.\n\n\"The Sea Beneath the Sky\", Gammons' second volume of poetry, received critical acclaim, and was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in 2002. He wrote an instructional guide to reading poetry, and has lectured at universities including Yale, Brown and Georgetown.

The invention also concerns a drive for a turbojet engine having a rotating propeller, and comprising a drive assembly, having a drive motor that can rotate the propeller, the drive assembly being situated in a flow area of air downstream of the propeller.\nIn current commercial turbojet engine design, the air flow through the turbojet engine is driven by means of turbine engines, which are located close to the aft end of the engines. Turbines are used to produce energy from the hot exhaust gas, which can be coupled via turbine gearsets to a propeller, which is situated at the aft end of the engine.\nIn a commercial aircraft engine, the propeller is driven in a power operation mode. Such a power operation mode is characterized in that in the event of an emergency, so-called runaway, the turbojet engine rotates so that the aircraft can perform aerodynamic flight. During this flight, the energy for thrust is generated in the turbojet engine by the rotating propeller.\nSuch a known turbojet engine is shown in FIG. 1.

Here, the retention gear 5 must perform a rotational movement for disengaging the retention gear. During such a disengaging movement, the retention gear meshes with respect to an engagement gear 4, which is secured axially to the propeller and which likewise performs a rotational movement.

The photoetching method, in which a pattern is formed by the irradiation with UV rays using a mask and the subsequent exposure to light, the development and the like, can make the shape of the pattern finer because it can use an arbitrary combination of a beam of light and a mask. The photoetching method for making a pattern, which is used for a large-sized circuit or the like, can be realized in a small-sized semiconductor device. Recently, miniaturization techniques of the line width and the like are being improved and the miniaturization has come to a level such that a pattern which could not be realized in the conventional process is realizable.\nHowever, with the photoetching method, a very high accuracy technique is required to obtain a desired pattern. Therefore, this method is effective for only the very fine pattern such a DRAM, but not practical for pattern with a line width of 1 to 2 μm or more. Furthermore, where a thin film such as an insulating layer which is required to have a pattern is formed by the photoetching (so-called dry etching) method, the patterning rate and the accuracy are not sufficient compared to the photoetching method, and therefore the dry etching method is not very practical either.\nOn the other hand, a method such as the RIE (Reactive Ion Etching) or the ion mill has now allowed the formation of a pattern which could not be obtained by photoetching. This method can form a pattern having a large aspect ratio, so is called a large aspect ratio process, and is called as large aspect ratio microprocessing in general. It can be said of this process that the large aspect ratio microprocessing is still in an experimental stage. One of the reasons for that is that this method is not only high in equipment to be purchased, but also the operation has not been standardized.\nHowever, in a step in which a pattern is formed by the large aspect ratio process, it is necessary to realize a small difference in processing between a pattern to be used for forming a region to which an impurity will be introduced or the like and a pattern to which an impurity will not be introduced or the like.

And it turns out it’ll have just as big an impact on mobile, too. On Thursday, Facebook announced a number of changes to Facebook Messenger designed to make it a more central part of your mobile life.\n\nPerhaps the biggest change is that the social network is shutting down the ability to send photos from Facebook for Messenger, and then they’re sending those photos through the much narrower and more focused Messenger. That means if you take a photo and want to share it to a friend, you’ll have to choose between posting it to Facebook first, and doing that through Messenger by sending the photo (or, if you’re already in Messenger, by choosing one of the other more traditional sharing options for Messenger instead).\n\nThis is going to upset a lot of people.\n\nYes, we’re in an era of social media where we post a lot of things to Facebook, and even take a lot of photos with our phones. As the person who started and runs a business based around making tools to help keep data more secured and private online, it certainly makes sense to send a lot of that data through secure messaging apps instead of Facebook’s insecure and often-exploitative platform. In addition to WhatsApp and Snapchat, Facebook has been trying to court Instagram to also be a secure messaging app; Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom has been actively trying to bring Instagram closer and closer to WhatsApp and Messenger.\n\nFacebook’s actions against WhatsApp and the Instagram app makes it look like they’re trying to force customers to use one app or another — or that they’re going to be forced to do so.

Field of the Invention\nThis invention relates generally to semiconductor devices and their fabrication and, more particularly, to a method for increasing semiconductor device speed using high speed CMOS transistors.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nHigh speed CMOS devices often include very thin gate oxides. However, a CMOS transistor includes an N-channel device region and a P-channel device region. At interface boundaries formed by the edge of the gate of each of the CMOS regions, electrons flow at very high current densities by majority charge collection (MCC). At extremely small dimensions (e.g., less than about 0.25 xcexcm gate oxide thickness), electrons may leak into the substrate resulting in excessive leakage current.\nReferring to FIG. 1, the leakage current results when there is a voltage differential across the gate oxide at the xe2x80x9cfield edgesxe2x80x9d. For example, an N-type field effect transistor (NFET) 100 is formed on P type substrate 102. Gate 110 is separated from P type well 108 by thick field oxides 106 formed on well 108. The leakage current is in direct proportion to the thickness of the oxide, so that decreasing the thickness of the gate oxide region decreases the leakage current. However, at extremely thin oxide thicknesses, the leakage current increases to unacceptable levels. Thus, for this example, there is a tradeoff between leakage current due to direct tunneling current, and direct leakage current across the gate oxide to substrate.\nAs device gate oxide thickness becomes even thinner relative to gate lengths, charge trapping by defect states in the oxide may add to direct tunnel current. Such trapping may cause the gate electrode to lose its gate potential, resulting in what is known as a negative bias stress. When the gate electrode loses its gate potential, the leakage current continues at high current density levels, although it may not be at a leakage current in actual operation (e.g., a gate level). This condition may remain until gate potential is re-established.\nIn general, high current densities in the P-channel device region and the N-channel device region are to be avoided for high performance CMOS devices. For example, high current densities in NFET 100 result in extremely high drive currents which may cause latch-up of the MOSFET. Latch-up can occur when two NFETs are turned on together to forward bias a PNPN structure. Thus, the P-", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

In most cell types, centromeric regions of chromosomes are always located at the center of the nucleus and at the boundary of the nucleoli. Thus, a mitotic centromere-nucleolus association is normally observed. However, we report here that a mitotic centromeres-nucleolus association is induced in larval salivary gland polytene chromosomes at the first mitotic division and a nucleolus is never associated with the centromere of chromosomes. Our results suggest that the centrosome, one of the major nucleating centers, might be excluded from the mitotic centromeres-nucleolus association when the centromeres initiate mitotic spindle attachment to the chromosomes. Two types of centromere-nucleolus associations, \"spindle-attached\" and \"spindle-independent types\", were identified by their different mechanisms of initiation through mitotic spindle attachment. The formation of type I centromere-nucleolus association involves the spindle attachment to chromosomes and the nucleolus and centromere are associated in one chromatid. On the other hand, the formation of type II centromere-nucleolus association does not require mitotic spindle attachment and the centromere and nucleolus associate in both of chromatids.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

To investigate Werner syndrome pathogenesis, we isolated human primary fibroblasts from Werner patients and compared the cellular phenotype in fibroblasts from Werner syndrome patients and control human primary fibroblasts. The telomerase activity in fibroblasts at different passage numbers of cultures was significantly lower in human primary fibroblasts from Werner syndrome patients than those from control subjects. There were no significant differences in apoptosis and senescence markers between control and Werner cells. The expression levels of senescence-associated β-galactosidase and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2 were also similar on passage 12 in control and Werner primary fibroblasts. In contrast, the expression levels of β-galactosidase in primary fibroblasts from Werner patients were strikingly increased on passage 4 (1.2-fold) and passage 8 (1.5-fold) compared with control cells. The expression of p21/CIP1 (WAF1/CIP1) and other telomere-protecting proteins, such as Ku70/86, was similar on passage 12 in control and Werner primary fibroblasts. p16/INK4A expression was lower in Werner primary fibroblasts than in control cells but not sufficient to explain their telomere dysfunction. Immuno-FISH assay also showed that the mean telomere length of chromosomal ends was shorter in Werner fibroblasts than in control fibroblasts. Moreover, we successfully obtained p16/INK4A null cells after gene targeting mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and generated a p16/INK4A KO mouse model. Werner-1 and p16/INK4A KO cells exhibited similar cell proliferation compared with wt cells.

To achieve this, it is important that the film-forming composition remains uniformly bonded to the carrier web throughout the production sequence.\nIt is well documented that a key parameter for maintaining the proper performance profile of hot-melt, adhesive-applied wallpaper machines in the market is to maintain the correct temperature profile in the nip. More specifically, an ideal temperature profile in the nip for hot-melt, adhesive-applied wallpaper machines in the printing process is a temperature profile that will cause a constant increase of temperature in the nip from the web side to the carrier web side. Typically the temperature at the web side is greater than the temperature at the carrier web side, and the temperature difference across the nip increases from the web side to the carrier web side. This is because of the higher heat capacity of the carrier web as compared to the hot-melt, adhesive-applied web. The reason to have a temperature difference across the nip has to do with the printing process. This method causes the film-forming composition of the web to become heated as the heat is transferred from the web. This causes the", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a process for producing a substrate for a magnetic recording medium and various magnetic disks or magnetic tapes formed of the substrate.\nThe term \"magnetic recording medium\" hereinafter refers to all of the various magnetic media such as a magnetic disk, magnetic tape and a magnetic card and the like used to record information signals, i.e. their magnetic recording surfaces.\n2. Description of the Relevant Art\nThe demand for high density recording has been rapidly expanded in recent years. To obtain sufficient recording density, the thickness of the medium should desirably be reduced. This requirement of the art can not be satisfied without having a substrate for a medium made thinner.\nKnown magnetic recording media have their substrates formed of plastic materials. The plastic substrate has a thickness of 0.2 to 0.8 mm and the substrate used for the flexible magnetic disk is so much thinner than that. If, however, the substrate used for the flexible magnetic disk is thinner than 0.5 mm, the recording density is not sufficient, because of the small number of tracks obtained per unit area.\nTo enlarge the usable recording capacity per unit area, it is necessary to increase the number of tracks. To realize this, it is desirable to obtain a high recording density and to thereby reduce the width of each track. It is also necessary, however, to ensure a proper distance in between each track, to prevent them from overlapping each other and from crossexisting. The distance (pitch), between two adjacent tracks is very important for obtaining a high recording density. Thus, it is necessary that the disk be made thinner and that the number of tracks be increased. However, if the thickness of a magnetic disk is reduced to a value of 0.5 to 0.2 mm and the number of tracks is increased, the distance between the tracks should be set to at least 0.8-1.0 mm. Thus, the number of tracks is restricted.\nAs described below, the magnetic recording medium using a plastic substrate has several drawbacks. According to the process of conventional techniques, a plastic film is obtained by extruding a thermoplastic resin in the molten state through a slit-faced cylinder rotated at high speed and the extrudate is cooled to form a thin circular plastic sheet. Thereafter, each plastic substrate is made by laminating the plastic sheet in a predetermined thickness on a suitable base member through an adhesive layer, so as to obtain a plastic substrate having a thickness in", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates generally to the field of corn breeding. In particular, the invention relates to corn seed and plants of the variety designated CV556813, and derivatives and tissue cultures thereof.\n2. Description of Related Art\nThe goal of field crop breeding is to combine various desirable traits in a single variety/hybrid. Such desirable traits include greater yield, better stalks, better roots, resistance to insecticides, herbicides, pests, and disease, tolerance to heat and drought, reduced time to crop maturity, better agronomic quality, higher nutritional value, and uniformity in germination times, stand establishment, growth rate, maturity, and fruit size.\nBreeding techniques take advantage of a plant's method of pollination. There are two general methods of pollination: a plant self-pollinates if pollen from one flower is transferred to the same or another flower of the same plant. A plant cross-pollinates if pollen comes to it from a flower on a different plant.\nCorn plants (Zea mays L.) can be bred by both self-pollination and cross-pollination. Both types of pollination involve the corn plant's flowers. Corn has separate male and female flowers on the same plant, located on the tassel and the ear, respectively. Natural pollination occurs in corn when wind blows pollen from the tassels to the silks that protrude from the tops of the ear shoot.\nPlants that have been self-pollinated and selected for type over many generations become homozygous at almost all gene loci and produce a uniform population of true breeding progeny, a homozygous plant. A cross between two such homozygous plants produces a uniform population of hybrid plants that are heterozygous for many gene loci. Conversely, a cross of two plants each heterozygous at a number of loci produces a population of hybrid plants that differ genetically and are not uniform. The resulting non-uniformity makes performance unpredictable.\nThe development of uniform corn plant hybrids requires the development of homozygous inbred plants, the crossing of these inbred plants, and the evaluation of the crosses. Pedigree breeding and recurrent selection are examples of breeding methods used to develop hybrid parent plants from breeding populations. Those breeding methods combine the genetic backgrounds from two or more inbred plants or various other broad-based sources into breeding pools from which new inbred plants are developed by selfing and selection of desired phenotypes.

Upon graduating from New York Medical College in 1843 he entered a medical practice in Kingston, where he soon became interested in the care of women. He then set up what was then the first practical surgical ward, and in 1849 published a report on obstetric practice that would later be a standard textbook.\n\nIn 1852 Wilson moved to Chicago to establish a free clinic and free dispensary and to lecture on surgery and other subjects on the reform of medical education, a cause his father had been devoted to at home. By 1854 the operation of the clinic was successful and it became known to the medical establishment as the \"Maternity and Infant Home\". That same year Wilson published one of the first serious books on a subject to come under the term \"hygiene\". He was then able to interest his friends in the suffrage movement, and when Horace Greeley became the proprietor of the New-York Tribune, Wilson was appointed as his private sanitary advisor. He became increasingly interested in the new profession of journalism and in 1865 began to engage in it as a profession.\n\nWilson became increasingly enmeshed with the women's suffrage movement as it gained steam during the 1870s, and in 1870 he began to campaign that women should be allowed to vote. When a delegation of suffrage advocates arrived in Washington, D.C. seeking support, he wrote an essay on their causes which was published in several popular newspapers. They then met with President Ulysses S. Grant, who assured them of an official White House statement in their favor, and the passage of the Susan B. Anthony National Suffrage Bill the next year. Wilson was a member of the National WCTU and actively participated in its campaigns.\n\nAs public interest in sanitary sanitation increased, Wilson began to spend more time devising practical answers to problems.

Description of the Prior Art\nAs a measure for improving the battery performance, a method of adjusting concentrations of electrolytes has been proposed. For instance, in Japanese patent application No. 56-119958, it was proposed to add potassium cyanide to the aqueous solution of the electrolytes in order to decrease the over voltage due to internal resistance of the cell. On the other hand, it is desirable to add electrolyte to the solution to prevent the solution from becoming so concentrated to lead to the possibility of electrolyte explosion, since the electrolyte explosion is a large cause of the deterioration of the battery life. As a method of measuring the ion concentration in the aqueous solution of the electrolyte by using an ion selective electrode (hereinafter referred to as a.beta.-type electrode), there are known an indirect method using a pH meter and a direct method using a liquid electrolytic meter.\nHowever, the indirect method is susceptible to measurement error because the electrode must be placed in the solution to be measured, while the direct method can measure the solution only under extremely high accuracy. Furthermore, both methods can be applied only for measuring a specific ion concentration in a certain electrolyte.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

A semiconductor memory device (e.g., a DRAM) and an LSIO are commonly used for the package of an IC system in which the DRAMS are used as main storage, the LSIs are used for control, and various electronic components are used for input, output, and other parts. Since the DRAMS of larger storage capacities are recently developed so that the main storage can be used for large capacity data processing in data processing systems, the power consumption of the IC system tends to increase with the development of the DRAM.\nThere are already used semiconductor memory devices (e.g., DRAM's) of different capacity ranges such as a 16-Mbit DRAM, an 8-Mbit DRAM, and a 4-Mbit DRAM. A power supply voltage of a 5V level for the 16-Mbit DRAM, a 5.5V level for the 8-Mbit DRAM, and a 6.5V level for the 4-Mbit DRAM is used for supplying power. Power consumption for the DRAM's, a control LSI (i.e., a PPU), and other parts which are supplied with the power supplied from the DRAM's are determined by voltage drop characteristics thereof.\nHowever, since there are restrictions in a mounting area within the IC system, it is not realistic to adopt the 5V power supply (for the DRAM having the large storage capacity) for the LSIs (for example, a main control circuit) operating at a 3.3V power supply voltage. Therefore, the power supply voltage of a lower level which is used for the LSIs to operate at the same timing with the LSIs of the DRAMs (for example, at the 5.5V power supply voltage for the 8-Mbit DRAM) must be used for the LSIs.\nFor example, in an IC system which comprises an 8-Mbit DRAM and an 8-bit LSIs, the DRAM and the LSIs operate at the 5.5V power supply voltage level which is reduced to a power supply voltage of 1/2. Further, even in the case where there are provided the LSIs whose power supply voltage", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Field of the Disclosure\nEmbodiments disclosed herein relate generally to methods and apparatus for performing separation of particles in a fluid stream. More specifically, embodiments disclosed herein relate to an electrophoretic separation unit in a fluid stream.\n2. Background\nIn many applications, it is desirable to detect and/or quantify trace elements in fluids. However, such elements may be present as an extremely small percentage of the total bulk volume of the fluid, making it difficult to detect and/or quantify trace elements with conventional chemical methods. For example, it is relatively difficult to obtain a quantitative measurement of trace elements in body fluids, such as blood, when the trace elements are present in only parts per million to parts per billion of body fluid and not at all of a control standard (e.g., water). In addition, many trace elements are naturally occurring but are commercially available as isotope-enriched or enriched preparations.\nIn order to solve the aforementioned problems, certain methods have been developed for concentrating trace elements in fluids. One such method is capillary electrophoresis (CE), which provides both a separation and preconcentration step.\nIn capillary electrophoresis, the fluid sample is injected into a capillary tube and the fluid is separated based on the electrical properties of the sample. The separated components can then be detected electrochemically or can be passed into a subsequent detector, for example, optical (e.g., laser, fluorescence, absorption), which enables quantitative detection of a specific element from the separated components.\nAnother separation technique involves high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which offers numerous advantages including increased separation efficiency, improved separation resolution, automation, good solute compatibility and a rapid increase in sample throughput. The use of capillaries in HPLC has resulted in devices known as capillary chromatography. These systems consist of a capillary column packed with a stationary phase, either solid or liquid, into which a sample containing target components is introduced via a fluid stream or via sample introduction ports in the wall surface of the capillary tube, and the movement of the fluid itself is driven by a pump that forces a sample into the column and permits the solutes to selectively move along the column based on partition coefficients of the solutes with the stationary phase of the column and the solvent used.\nDuring use, the HPLC column contains the stationary phase to which a fluid sample containing a target material may bond. However, the bonding between the fluid and the stationary phase is reversible which makes it possible", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

It is quite possible, however, that the effect of the stressors on the fetus will be to increase the susceptibility of the fetus to infection or stress or both to the point where the prognosis of the pregnancy is greatly reduced.\nFor the above reasons, a need exists for a means of safely and effectively terminating a mother's pregnancy in the first trimester, preferably later than 24 weeks gestation. Moreover, a procedure for terminating a pregnancy in the mother which is not attended by any morbidity or trauma to the mother is also desirable.\nUterine contraction is an effective way to terminate pregnancies where a D&C is contraindicated; however, this type of procedure is limited to those cases where the fetus cannot survive gestation longer. The present invention eliminates the need for such an emergency abortion. For those pregnancies, where the mother has already lost substantial amounts of blood, such as in the case of EPH gestations, this procedure offers a safe and effective termination.\nAn elective abortion in the first trimester may be accomplished by the use of drugs to destroy fetal cells and tissue. However, such agents have generally fallen into disrepute and none have achieved FDA-approved status for first trimester abortions. There appears to be no known effective procedure for terminating a first trimester pregnancy by aspiration alone. The present invention offers an effective means of terminating a first trimester gestation such as those pregnancies which have a low likelihood of viability, while simultaneously avoiding the risks associated with more traditional second trimester procedures.\nThe present invention involves an aspiration process, with or without induction of contractions in the mother for terminating a first trimester gestation. Preferably, the aspiration is done after the fetus has been removed by suction after the death of the fetus. As a direct result of the practice of the present invention, neither the placenta nor any tissue from the fetus is left in the uterus. This allows the uterus to contract more effectively, potentially resulting in fewer complications. Aspiration provides immediate relief of bleeding and pain. Moreover, the use of aspartate, or any other agents that may prevent formation of blood clots can be used for the initial abortion attempt, if necessary. The use of drugs is a means for terminating pregnancy that is less safe and more expensive than aspiration but it is currently practiced as part of second trimester EPH termination.\nThe present invention also includes the use of an elective abortion under conditions similar to", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

For a better understanding of the determinants and effects of such a disease, and to improve the care for patients, the aim of the current study was to assess epidemiological aspects of pediatric urolithiasis in the province of Calabria. All the children that had been hospitalized in the province of Reggio Calabria in January 1999 and underwent the complete diagnostic work up for idiopathic or renal stone disease, for a period of 6 months, were included in the study. The cases of idiopathic renal stone disease were analyzed according to age, sex, seasonality of the illness, type of stone, location, presence of a metabolic disease, other pathology and previous treatment. For calculi, according to site and type, the following variables were considered: size, presence of a growth mechanism and presence of infection. Moreover, urinary parameters and serum metabolic profile were assessed. Among the 3,532 cases of idiopathic renal stone disease, 57% were female. Children under 3 years of age accounted for 26.6% of the whole group. A peak incidence of stone disease was seen from 8 to 14 years of age (34.3%). About half of the cases were diagnosed in the winter months. About two third of the lesions were found in the proximal ureter and in the distal thirds of the renal collecting system. Renal stones were found in 80.7% of the cases. The most frequent calculus type was calcium phosphate accounting for 57.5% of all the cases. Of these patients, 14.9% had a metabolic disease, 4.6% had a congenital metabolic disease, and another 11.2% had been previously surgically treated for a renal stone of the same type. Finally, urinary metabolic parameters, as well as serum calcium and phosphate were significantly correlated with stone presence. We conclude that pediatric urolithiasis is more frequent in young girls and children under 3 years. Also, the disease often occurs in non-spring months and affects both the proximal and the distal segments of the ureter. Calcium phosphate is the most common calculi found in the pediatric population. A significant proportion of patients have at least one metabolic renal stone. Serum metabolic abnormalities and certain urinary parameters are associated with a higher risk for the onset of a", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

More specifically, the invention is directed to the design of a disposable, thin film biosensor with high-level biosensing and analytical characteristics, including a relatively wide linear range of detection limits and measurement ranges. This invention is particularly suited for a diagnostic assay in a small instrument in which a test substrate and measuring instrument are in intimate contact in a portable testing device. The invention has applications as a point-of-care (POC) diagnostic, a laboratory test and/or an in vitro diagnostics test. The invention can be configured as a whole-blood test, a whole-serum, or a serum.\nThe invention is designed for a diagnostic analytical assay in a small handheld analysis device that combines test and measurement operations on the same substrate. An analyte is sensed or detected in the substrate by an electrically-conductive solid state test element, preferably a thin-film test element, and the sensor output signal is sensed by a sensing electrode to detect the presence, quantity, or concentration of the analyte.\nThe invention is based on biosensors that incorporate the use of electrical contacts for sensing analyte concentration. Devices have been disclosed in which two or more conductive elements are configured to measure the difference in electrochemical potential between two, adjacent layers of contact that are used to establish electrically closed electrical circuits. An example of such a device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,532,461 (Yurkievych, 1970). The Yurkievych device is a metal/polymer-modified electrode having an insulator surrounding the metal layer and located between the metal layer and the polymer-modified surface. A second insulator layer, in contact with the metal layer, is located inside and outside the insulator to form the closed circuit. The Yurkievych electrode is designed to establish electrochemical potential difference between the metal/polymer and the metal/second metal layer. Electrochemical potentials do not vary monotonically with the concentration of an electroactive species in solution. U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,352 (Kamper et al., 1992) discloses an electrochemical cell, wherein three contact metal layers sandwich a dielectric layer, such that the metal layers together form a closed electric circuit.

However, surgery is not always indicated and in particular in severely affected patients a medical treatment approach might be preferred. This observational study was carried out to assess the effectiveness of an antiinflammatory medical treatment on the subjective symptoms and disease parameters of CRSwNP. All treated patients (n = 50) with documented CRSwNP (Schiller criteria) received at least 6 months of oral corticosteroid (OCS) treatment, and were followed up 12 months after the baseline evaluation (Visit 01). The primary aim was to assess the efficacy of this treatment by evaluating the results by the following variables: symptom score, endoscopical grading scale (EGS), Lund-Mackay (LM) score (LMS), nasal polyp index (NPI) and Lund-Kennedy (LK) surgery rate score. The secondary aim was to identify possible predictors to assess nonresponder patients for an alternative medical treatment. The mean age and gender distribution of the 50 patients (35 females, 15 males) were as follows: 25 years (SD), 10.7 years; 27.5% female and 72% male.

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates generally to the fields of protein biochemistry and medicine. More particularly, the invention involves the identification of a small molecule inhibitor which specifically interacts with and inhibits an essential element of the protein complex involved in the HIV transactivation process. Such inhibition serves as a basis for the development of new drug therapies for the treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infections caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The invention also relates to methods for screening compounds for their ability to inhibit HIV activation.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nThe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is the causative agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and has been implicated in the etiology of a large number of other diseases, including AIDS related complex (ARC), AIDS related neurological disease (ANL), cytomegalovirus-associated retinitis, and AIDS related non-Hodgkin\"\"s lymphoma ([Fauci, 1996, The AIDS Therapeutic Revolution; New England Medical Publishers; Rowley, P., Editor, The Retroviruses; Appleton, Avery, and Lang, 1992; Harrison\"\"s Principles of Internal Medicine: Isselbacher, Friedmann, and Wilson, Editors]. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes several enzymes that are integral to viral replication, such as the RT, IN and IN/RT that are involved in the viral DNA synthesis, IN that is an integrase and the protease which cleaves the viral polyprotein into its constituent proteins and a portion of RT ([Achbar, 1995, The Retroviruses]; Harrison\"\"s Principles of Internal Medicine: Isselbacher, Friedmann and Wilson, Editors.\nThe viral protease (PR) is encoded by open reading frame (ORF) 1 of the HIV pol gene, and is expressed as a result of the splicing of the gag, pol and env RNAs. The PR gene includes two exons, and encodes a polyprotein which is proteolytically processed to yield mature structural and enzymatic polypeptides as reviewed in [Hacker and Coen, 1990, Ann. Rev.

The electric contact is formed by means of welding, riveting and so on. Each piece of the electric contact is put into a metal mold, and the metal mold is heated at a temperature as high as 260.degree. C. so that solder is flowed between the electric contacts and between the electric contacts and a conductor. After welding, the electric contacts thus-sintered, and the conductor are subjected to soldering.\nThis sintering takes a long time and consumes a long time in manufacturing the electric contact.\nTo reduce the manufacture time and space, the inventor has invented the electric contact structure (disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 60-96640) in which the electric contacts are each fixed in a groove made in a bottom of a metal mold in such a manner that the electric contact is formed from the bottom surface of the metal mold by machining the bottom surface. These electric contacts are arranged in a line. Then, solder is flowed between the electric contacts thus-arranged in the bottom of the metal mold. Thus, a required number of pieces of electric contacts are put into the metal mold in a single operation, and then, the metal mold is heated, so that the electric contacts are sintered.\nIf the electric contacts are sintered in the metal mold in this manner, however, the electric contacts are not securely fixed to the metal mold, and the electric contacts move relative to each other. Accordingly, it is difficult to flow solder between the electric contacts properly.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

In fact, I believe that we all make at least one big resolution every year – one that we set up to get something done that we’ve been putting off for too long. But every year, we fail to meet these goals by either not putting in enough effort or because we don’t maintain our motivation. It’s easy to let go of these dreams, and once our new years resolutions begin to fade, we can become disillusioned and frustrated. If you have ever gone down that road, don’t despair! It is not the end – you will eventually find a way out of the rut you’re currently in. You just might need to give your ‘resolution’ another try!\n\nFor the past six or seven years, I have made a resolution every year – my goal would be to lose weight, improve my appearance and get fit. This year, it ended up being my weight. After seeing my sister getting married and me having a baby just weeks before, I was absolutely not going to let myself get heavier. I had been on the dieting bandwagon and been making the usual changes to my lifestyle in an effort to change. But I was not successful in my attempt, even though my efforts had been rather valiant. After months of trying, I decided to step up my game. I am pleased to say that I have now completed my goal of weight loss within the timeframe I set (just days before giving birth). In fact, I have even lost another pound or two. I want to be honest with you – I tried EVERYTHING to lose the weight and failed to do it. And what was my response to that? It’s amazing how something that you didn’t accomplish in one year can become a goal for the next year, with almost no effort. Instead of becoming discouraged, I decided to put my efforts towards something I can accomplish and use everyday to meet the rest of my goals: physical fitness.\n\nThis past week, I took my first running group exercise class! It was a class, mostly made up of women, who were there to support each other to reach their fitness goals. I am so excited and will continue to be.

More particularly, the invention relates to a non-exposure resist pattern forming method having an excellent property in pattern formability with regard to pattern shape control.\nA non-exposure resist pattern forming method has hitherto been known in which the light transmittance of a resist layer applied onto a substrate to be processed is measured in a non-light exposure region thereof, and development is carried out only in a non-light exposure region while the resist layer is exposed in a region other than a region in which light transmittance is low and, if exposed resist is then developed and rinsed, the film thickness of the resist pattern is controlled based on the light transmittance measured.\nIn such a pattern forming method, the film thickness of the developed resist pattern is sometimes not uniform in the longitudinal and transverse direction due to the effects of unevenness in development caused, for example, by temperature distribution in development or by heat accumulation in a resist layer. In case where two kinds of light sources, for example, a pulsed NdYVO.sub.4 laser and a continuous argon laser, are respectively used to form resist patterns of different thicknesses, a resist pattern of one kind of light source has different film thickness in the longitudinal and transverse direction if each film thickness cannot be controlled precisely with individual lasers or, by means of a single laser, if individual pulses cannot be used. Where the resist pattern is formed with pulsed NdYVO.sub.4 laser beams to increase productivity in production of semiconductor devices, therefore, the resist film thickness in longitudinal and transverse direction can be controlled by adjusting the number of pulses of the laser beams per unit of length in the longitudinal direction. In order to form resist patterns of differing lengths by simply adjusting the number of pulses to be irradiated by the pulsed NdYVO.sub.4 laser, a mechanism must be provided to control the number of pulses irradiated by the laser without using a shutter and a shutter mechanism is therefore required. In case where a single laser source for continuously providing laser beams is used, no control mechanism is required in forming a resist pattern of a desired length.\nA resist pattern having a film thickness which does not depend on the longitudinal and transverse direction can be formed in the following manner.

Human participants performed forearm isometric handgrip exercise at 30% or 60% of their maximum voluntary contraction for periods of 2, 4, and 6 minutes. Responses were measured by venous occlusion plethysmography, blood flow measured by venous Doppler ultrasound, and blood flow distribution measured by venous strain-gauge plethysmography. Compared with control conditions (n=10, 8 men, 2 women), responses following administration of the NOS inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) (n=7, 5 men, 2 women) were not significantly different. The response to isometric handgrip exercise was significantly reduced in the presence of the NOS inhibitor nitro-L-arginine. The percentage decreases in blood flow distribution during exercise were 11% (P=0.016), 17% (P=0.003), and 16% (P=0.01) using the L-NMMA and nitro-L-arginine. However, the reduction in blood flow distribution was not proportional to the decrease in percent blood flow.

There are two ways of life on the internet. You either learn to live in isolation or you learn to live with your surroundings. Both of these can work because, at least you know, once things go wrong, no one will be around to help you. The third and most common choice for the internet-dwelling consumer are to live with a mixture of these two types of people. This is called the internet.\n\n4. <<<The internet is a place where information is created from the real world. The internet in reality is a place where information about the real world is created. But by its very nature, it does not care about the real world. Instead, it creates information that has nothing to do with reality and is completely made up.>>>\n\n5. The internet isn't a place where people live. People are not living on the internet, they are pretending to live on the internet. People pretend to live in a house where they don't live. They pretend to use a computer that they don't have. They pretend to use a smartphone that they don't have. They pretend that a website is relevant to their individual life (because they have nothing greater to pursue).

However, for reasons of safety and convenience, the tank should be placed in a vertical position, and it can be filled, for example, by being placed on a support or conveyor. In this connection, the support or conveyor is positioned on a base which is fixed in place and is not itself movable, to permit the fluid transfer operation to proceed. Such a fixed base is known for use in connection with other fluid transfer operations.\nIn another application, fluid storage tanks or other storage tanks or enclosures are provided with a base, and the upper portion thereof includes a fluid outlet, for example the tank bottom. In this connection, it has been recognized that, with certain fluids such as a combustible and/or flammable fluid, for example propane, it is undesirable to permit an open flame or spark to be produced in close proximity to the storage tank in order to pour such fluids and thereby prevent the combustion of the fluid in the storage tank. This is because the spark or flame may ignite the fluid in the storage tank.\nWith regard to certain vehicles, such as fire trucks, it is desirable to be able to quickly and efficiently place the storage tank on a base. This is particularly important in order to prevent the storage tank from tipping over and spilling such fluids as may be contained or held within the tank. In this connection, if the fuel-containing tank is placed on a tilted base, the tank can tip over, and, depending in part, on the design of the base, spill the fuel.\nIt is therefore desirable to provide a container for storing a fluid, the container including a base and an enclosed compartment formed integrally in the base for holding the fluid. The container is arranged to be placed in a vertical position for filling, and thereby store, the fluid, and thereafter placed in a horizontal position while the fluid is poured and transferred from the container.

In a cross-sectional study we enrolled 16-year-old girls (mean age 15.3 ± 0.3years; N = 1174) and measured anthropometric and body composition parameters according to standardized guidelines. Early menarche, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) were not significantly different between obese (BMI ≥ 95th% centile, n = 70 (4.9% of analyzed group)) and non-obese (n = 1164) girls, however they were significantly higher in the total group than among boys of the same age. In the multivariate logistic regression model, menarche at any age, compared to menarche after 3years was associated with an increased risk of overweight/obesity. Odds ratio (OR) = 1.7 (95%CI: 1.2, 2.2); P < 0.001), and obesity (OR = 1.7; 95%CI: 1.1, 2.6), and for central obesity with OR = 2.0 (95%CI: 1.1, 3.2), P < 0.001). Early menarche was not directly associated with DM, MS, dyslipidemias, insulin resistance and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) score.

As shown in FIG. 1, the total pressure 1 of exhaust gas is the sum of the static pressure 2 of an air intake tube, the differential pressure 3 between the exhaust gas pressure 1 inside the exhaust gas passage and the atmospheric pressure 4 outside the exhaust gas passage, and the pressure due to the effect of centrifugal force 5 which acts on the exhaust gas.\nIt will be noted that the differential pressure 3 and centrifugal force 5 act in the upstream direction of the exhaust gas because the exhaust gas in the exhaust gas passage is compressed in the upstream direction by the action of centrifugal force and then is expanded. More specifically, the exhaust gas is compressed by the centrifugal force and then is blown back through a venturi toward the atmosphere to be expanded in the atmosphere.\nThese differential pressure 3 and centrifugal force 5 increase due to the increased temperature of the exhaust gas, for example, at about 300.degree. C. Therefore, a greater change in the differential pressure 3 is produced than in the static pressure 2, for example, by about 30% at the above-mentioned temperature and the total pressure 1 can be detected as the sum of the static pressure 2 and the differential pressure 3.\nFIG. 2 shows a conventional device for calculating a total pressure 1 obtained from the difference between the static pressure 2 of an air intake tube and the differential pressure 3 between the pressure P inside the exhaust gas passage of an engine and the pressure P' outside the exhaust gas passage. The total pressure 1 obtained from the difference between the static pressure 2 of the intake tube and differential pressure 3 is given as follows: ##EQU1## in which e is the difference between 1 and k, and k is a constant depending on engine conditions and engine output.\nThe total pressure 1 is then detected at both ends of an exhaust gas passage after being subjected to the pressure by a pressure sensor 6. The total pressure 1 which can be detected is only the total pressure 1 which is the sum of the differential pressure 3 and the static pressure 2.

Two hundred children aged from 5 to 14 undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis were compared with 200 cases treated with open appendectomy. The 2 groups were compared regarding demographic profile, perioperative outcomes, and cost of care. Both groups were comparable in terms of mean age and sex. Mean operation time was shorter in the open appendectomy group (50.5 and 36.3 minutes respectively). Wound infection rates were found to be higher (8.00%) in the laparoscopic appendectomy group. Mean hospital stay was higher in the laparoscopic appendectomy group (3.22 days), but the difference was found to be statistically insignificant. The mean expense of treatment was found to be higher in the open appendectomy group (3066/- and 2422/- per operation respectively). While, the median cost of laparoscopic surgery was higher than open appendectomy (2090/- and 1350/- per operation respectively).

The highest hydrolysis and bioethanol productions occurred after 72 h of incubation. When the heating time was shortened to 48 h, ethanol in the hydrolyzed solution reached only 23.2% of the ethanol yield derived from the initial dry solid material. In this hydrolysis process, the amount of total solids, total saccharification and solid residue was increased by the inoculation with P. putida, whereas the bio-oil percentage was reduced from 33.8% (untreated sewage sludge) to 22.2% after 72 h of incubation.

However, the fatty alcohol 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid (12-HDA) is also a component of the human brain, and is formed by the sequential actions of fatty alcohol dehydrogenase from decanoic acid and lauric acid or omega-3 fatty acid desaturases from DHA. We aimed to determine whether 12-HDA supplementation could be effective for the treatment of metabolic syndrome using an insulin-resistant obese mouse model. Twelve-week-old C57BL/6J mice received 12-HDA (30mg/kg diet) or olive oil (as a control) for 11 days. Body weight, body fat percentage, serum triglyceride, serum glucose, insulin secretion and hepatic glycogen content were higher in 12-HDA-treated obese mice than in the control mice, with decreased triglyceride/HDL-cholesterol ratio (P<0.05). Insulin homeostasis test revealed that the intra-peritoneal glucose tolerance test (IpGTT) and oral (1 g/kg) glucose tolerance test (IoGTT) were improved in 12-HDA-treated obese mice compared with the control mice (P<0.05). This resulted from elevated insulin sensitivity as measured by the IpGTT (P<0.05) and insulin sensitivity index (P<0.05) calculated from IpGTT and IoGTT. Furthermore, 12-HDA treatment reduced inflammation (P<0.05) and ameliorated hepatosteatosis (P<0.05). Importantly, 12-HDA treatment had more favorable impact on metabolic syndrome than fish oil treatment. 12-HDA supplementation ameliorated metabolic syndrome in insulin-resistant obese mice.

If I were elected, I would want nothing more than to represent you. The bottom line is that I have been a Democrat all my life; I have had four different Democratic representatives in the Ohio House of Representatives, and two Democratic congressmen. I could name many more people who have either been Democrats or been a part of the political life of the city and the region. So, I want you to know that I am not out to change your party, only to serve you better as the elected officials of your county. I have always been a loyal Democrat and supporter of the Democratic Party. In fact, I have never had much contact with most Republicans and even less contact with Republicans and the Republican Party. My father was an active union member, and for many years, he served in the Ohio House of Representatives, one of the Democratic Representatives. After his retirement from public service, he became the Democratic leader of the Ohio House of Representatives, and he served until his retirement at the age of 73 in 1990. My parents have always been Democrats. My mother has voted for both Democratic and Republican candidates in the past, but always votes for Democrats. She has made it a point to vote for Democratic candidates whenever they have come or will be coming to serve our county. I would hope you, as my constituents, would do much the same thing! While this is a long time coming, I have decided it is time to move toward the next step in my political career. I have met with people from the two major political parties, and some that may not have political leanings, but simply want what is best for their community. I have come to realize that there are good men and women from both parties, but the party affiliation becomes a very minor part of their beliefs and convictions.

The invention is even more particularly related to the elastomerization of dimethylpolysiloxane-containing organopolysiloxane compositions which are applied to molds used to form ceramic articles.\nMany materials or compounds are sensitive to the action of heat and light. Glass, porcelain enamels, epoxies, elastomers and polyesters which have good properties when applied or embedded in, or set in, a base or substrate are known to lose some or most of their properties and become brittle and inflexible when subjected to the energy associated with curing. As a result, it is difficult to manufacture a wide variety of ceramic articles from molds containing such coatings.\nIn the past, it has been the practice to apply to molds in ceramic articles, polysiloxanes, either alone or in the presence of other compounds, to improve the adhesion of ceramics to a metal base, which base typically comprises a ferrous based alloy when fired at the temperatures common in the use of a mold to manufacture ceramic articles. The method of applying the polysiloxane usually involves cleaning the mold surface followed by applying a quantity of the polysiloxane to the surface of the mold with a brush or by dipping the mold into a container of the material. Upon application of the polysiloxane, the mold is usually rinsed and dried by means which will not cause undesirable effects during the firing of the mold.\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,066,722 discloses a polysiloxane-containing coating composition for molds which comprises a mixture of a hydroxy-terminated polydimethylsiloxane polymer, a chlorinated organosilane and a phenolic inhibitor. U.S. Pat. No. 3,993,717 describes a method for coating the inner surface of a mold to be used to form ceramic articles comprising cleaning the surfaces of the mold with an aqueous solution of a surfactant, applying to the cleaned surfaces a uniform layer of polysiloxane and drying the coated surfaces of the mold", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

The first angle measuring module, which is associated to an optical measuring module for determining the angular position of the angle measuring module, which itself is provided on a headband, is arranged to measure with respect to at least two head positions defined by a user of a first headband and when such first headband is moved around and/or lifted from the neck portion of the human, which is connected to other body portions. In particular, the angle of the neck portion is obtained in connection to the headband angle corresponding to the neck position. A second angle and/or other geometrical characteristics that depend on the first headband and the other body parts may be measured when the head band is lifted and/or moved with respect to the neck portion.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nThe present invention relates to a tool that measures an angular position of a human neck including an angular measuring system of the aforesaid type that uses one and the same headband, which comprises one and the same optical head measuring module, and two measuring modules arranged to measure a position of the headband relative to the neck itself and/or a position of the headband relative to the other parts of the human being.\nFrom the state of the art there are known devices which are used for measuring the position of a patient's head. Such devices comprise an apparatus which comprises a first device having a first headrest for supporting a patient's head, a second device for being in proximity to the first device and being connected thereto, and a processor. The processor determines angular movement of the first device relative to the second device.\nHowever, with devices of the aforesaid type it may be desirable to also determine the angular position of the head relative to the body. It is also desirable to measure other characteristics of the neck angle, such as the angle of the neck, the length of the neck and/or the length of the neck protruding between the jaw joints. Also, the head position relative to the neck may constitute different neck positions.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

The optimized geometric parameters, the HOMO-LUMO energy level and vibrational frequencies showed that 4PC is a polar molecule. The B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) method has been used to assign the vibrational modes of 4PC. The geometrical parameters indicate that the molecules can exist in π-bond.

I don't like this because there could be a case where this.testThread.join() throws an IOE even though it isn't null. \nIs there any other better way to do this?\n\nA:\n\nIf the threads are really not to interact in any way (and, therefore, can be run in different threads) then the thread interrupting should really serve no purpose whatsoever and be done outside of the method. \nAs for the second point, since Thread.currentThread() will be the executing thread and will always throw an IOException in try {..} blocks, it does not really matter that it is \"outside of the try block\" and thus, since no exceptions are thrown, there is no problem. If you're worried it could be more complicated to implement it this way (as e.g. a thread is not \"inheriting\" this behavior), then you cannot stop your currentThread, but could make a separate Thread that extends Thread.

Well, that’s true of the world in general, but Ebola really exists, it’s been a real problem in the past, it’s continuing to be a serious disease right now, and it’s likely that it’s going to remain a real problem in the future.\n\nMaybe the virus will disappear with the next flu season? Perhaps by the time it takes a third bite of fruit from a contaminated plant it will just be an old, forgotten problem. There is no need to panic; the world will just get over Ebola and it will carry on carrying on, as we have gotten used to doing. That’s how life is – diseases come and go.

Field of the Invention\nThe invention relates to a method and device for analyzing speech of a telephone subscriber, a speech analyzer, an integrated speech analyzer, and a speech analyzer system which can detect a speech pattern for the purpose of discriminating a call from a long-distance call among a plurality of call originations transmitted by a subscriber to a switching station.\n2. Description of the Related Art\nIn recent years, there are increasing demands for speech analyzing services for the purpose of providing speech services and speech analyzing services for preventing improper use of telecommunications services. There is a method for determining call originations based upon the analysis of a speech transmitted by a subscriber. However, a subscriber may cause a communication with a wrong destination. It would be good to discriminate a call originating with a wrong destination as well as a call originating from long distance by speech analysis.\nFor that purpose, some conventional methods for discriminating a call from a long distance use a distance between acoustic characteristics of a speech and a speech analyzing time, a ratio of fundamental frequency of a speech to total fundamental frequency, a pattern of word and sentence-break, an interval between a speech and a silence. These conventional methods are, however, based on the following premises.\n1 A telephone subscriber transmits speech.\n2 The speech is subjected to analysis and a comparison with a dictionary.\n3 A speech originating from the vicinity is discriminated from that originating from a long distance.\nThe method disclosed in Japanese Patent Disclosure (Kokai) Nos. 2-288925 and 2-288926 is based upon these premises and detects whether or not the distance between an analysis result and a pre-stored reference characteristic is within a predetermined range. The method disclosed in Japanese Patent Disclosure (Kokai) No. 6-291755 has an arrangement wherein an acoustic parameter (fundamental frequency, noise ratio, pause ratio, and pitch) obtained from a speech signal is compared with a corresponding parameter of a pre-stored reference characteristic, whereby a call originated within the same neighborhood as the pre-stored reference characteristic is discriminated from a call originated from a long distance.\nFor all of the above-mentioned conventional methods, a characteristic value is detected using speech obtained from the telephone subscriber, and a comparison is made with a pre-stored reference characteristic value, thus producing results depending on the telephone subscriber's ability or the state of environmental noise present when a speech is transmitted. For example, it is difficult to discriminate whether or not a call originated in", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Lower doses were ineffective; higher doses produced cardiac and respiratory arrest. The duration of pressor response of the first dose of endotoxin was 1.5 +/- 0.1 min (10 micrograms/kg i.v.); after the end of the response, the heart rate was at control level, i.e., significantly less than the control value of approximately 320 beats/min maintained by the baroreceptors.

Tissue expression of MUC2 is highly restricted in normal tissues, whereas it is markedly upregulated in neoplastic tissues in breast cancer, where it is also a biomarker of aggressive tumor types (Blanchet, R. et al., Cancer Res 63:898-905, 2003). While MUC2 expression is well-characterized immunohistochemically, in situ expression of human MUC2 has been described in adenocarcinomas but not in normal colonic mucosa (Mazarin, C. M. et al., Cancer Res 54:4832-4835, 1994). In pancreatic cancer, the glycoprotein MUC5AC is also a marker of cancer; in an immunohistochemical study of 88 pancreatic biopsies, MUC5AC was expressed in 81%. The association of MUC5AC with advanced malignancies was described in two studies. In the first, MUC5AC overexpressed pancreatic cancers were not associated with a favorable prognosis (Nordstrom, E. et al., Int J Surg Pathol 21:59-63, 2005). In the second study, both MUC5AC expression and high-grade tumors (grade III) were associated with a high mortality (Petersen, M. R. et al., Tumour Biol 25:2239-2246, 2004).\nAnother TAC is the sialyl Lewis X antigen, an epitope that is present on the carbohydrate moieties of a number of glycoproteins and glycolipids which is sialylated by the addition of either N-acetyl-galactosamine or N-acetyl-neuraminic acid.

We’re a team of researchers on the GOV.UK redesign, and I’d like to introduce you to a new tool called UCDB.\n\nThe GOV.UK redesign was a huge task. Its ambitious scope meant that many parts of the redesign had to be undertaken by different teams of people. It has therefore been a while since we’ve been able to provide regular and regular updates on the state of the redesign. So, I thought I’d write a summary of what we’ve been doing, and where we are now, in a blog post!\n\nFirst, to give some context, here’s the original GOV.UK. I’m not going to discuss it in too much detail – it’s in the public domain, so anybody who wants to know more can read it themselves. The important thing to understand is that there are big gaps, and we’ve only really started work on filling those gaps.\n\nHere is the revised GOV.UK. This isn't something we’ve actually started to complete yet, but at the time of writing, it's only missing some core content, some important navigation features, and some of the brand identity. The next post on this blog will discuss the current priorities for implementing specific functionality in the revised GOV.UK.\n\nNow a description.\n\nUCDB or User-Centric Data Browser is a tool we’re developing to help the different groups of people involved with the GOV.UK redesign make decisions about what exactly to implement, and to see the impact of those decisions. It’s a tool I’m developing to meet the needs of the people who are making those decisions, that’s all.\n\nUCDB is basically a webapp where you can input data about the specific kind of data you’re thinking about. You get to see a visualisation of that data and can make decisions about what the best course of action might be.\n\nThe tool is being developed with a team that I’ve been leading since the very start of the project, but has now reached independent status and is developing on its own now.\n\nWe’re starting with five core kinds of data, that we’re thinking about covering in more detail over time:\n\nCuration.

We had the pecan and blueberry salad, the pork chop, and their famous chocolate cake. The pecan and blueberry salad was by far the best dish at the meal, as was the pork chop. The cake was great as well, but we couldn't get past the flavor of the salad. I would definitely go back to Peasant Plucker. The restaurant itself was also quite nice. The decor was clean, simple and just had all the comfort food that you would desire in your kitchen. Prices were quite alright, as the quality of the food really made up the difference. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone, and I will be back for sure. Thanks a lot.\n\nHOLY SHIT, what the best lunch ever.

For example, the development of computer-based speech-recognition systems has been used in a number of commercial applications, including in telephone applications for call management for call centers.\nIn conventional computerized speech-recognition systems, speech data is typically stored on a medium such as a Compact Disc (CD) to be transferred to a computer so that the speech-recognition application can be used. The problem with this approach is that the amount of memory required in the computer and the time required to transfer the data from the medium to the computer is typically excessive, and limits the size, cost and/or speed of the computerized speech-recognition system used.\nOne method that is used in an attempt to address this problem is to use a speech synthesizer, such as “Targett,” commercially available from Speech Works, Inc. of St. Louis, Mo. The basic philosophy behind this type of speech synthesis approach is the ability to convert a string of phonemes into speech data. A phoneme is typically a smallest meaningful sound, such as a vowel, a consonant, or any combination of the two. The term “computer-generated speech (CGS)” is sometimes used to collectively refer to the variety of speech-synthesis techniques that are based on speech that is generated by the computer.\nThe CGS approach typically involves converting a verbal string of speech into a string of speech data by converting strings of digits and/or non-digit strings into speech data. The resulting speech data is then sent to a speech recognizer, such as a “Dragon” speech recognition system, commercially available from EDS Corporation of Redwood City, Calif. or “Targett,” commercially available from Speech Works, Inc. of St. Louis, Mo.\nExamples of verbal strings that typically are used in the CGS approach include the letters of the alphabet, telephone numbers, street names and restaurant names.\nIn one speech synthesizer, which is available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., the verbal strings are broken down into several substrings, each of which are recognized by the speech-recognition application. This type of speech synthesizer is referred to as a “substring approach.”\nIn some conventional approaches, a verbal string is converted to a numeric string referred to as a phonetic representation. This numeric string is then sent to the computer-based speech", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

This study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board and was conducted in an inpatient hospice/quarantine unit. Patients with a history of opioid use who were diagnosed with cancer and were receiving palliative care and receiving opioid therapy were included. The primary outcome was self-report of opioid withdrawal severity, as assessed by the Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale--4th version. The study evaluated 25 patients in total, with a mean age of 52 years and male/female ratio of 16:9. After randomization, nabilone patients reported significantly fewer withdrawal episodes (mean [SEM]), 6.9 [0.93], than placebo patients, 22.6 [2.85], at the study endpoint (P <.001), indicating that nabilone effectively reduced withdrawal. Nabilone patients described a lower self-report of overall opioid withdrawal symptoms (P =.02) and their pain severity at the study endpoint (P =.005) than placebo patients.

In many cases, titanium alloys have the ability to exhibit high strength and good formability. Unfortunately, however, titanium and titanium alloys in a variety of forms often possess a high affinity for oxidizing contaminants in the atmosphere or the surface of a workpiece. This results in a loss of ductility due to the formation of a surface layer of passive, brittle, thin and very tough oxide. While this oxide is usually substantially transparent, it can affect the appearance and corrosion resistance of the titanium-containing workpiece. Therefore, when using titanium and titanium alloys, techniques for inhibiting the formation of oxidation are required. The two most common methods of improving titanium alloy performance have been the inclusion of rare-earth elements and the inclusion of other alloys such as steel and other iron elements. However, these components increase cost of titanium and titanium alloy products.\nOther methods of improving titanium's performance that have been explored include additions of elements of known anticorrosion properties. Thus, for example, phosphorus was known to improve the corrosion resistance of titanium alloys, so that when phosphorus is added to titanium and titanium alloy to improve the corrosion resistance, the surface will be less passive and less prone to oxidation. U.S. Pat. No. 3,842,009 describes one group of titanium alloys which incorporate phosphorus into the titanium matrix. The phosphorus can be incorporated by making the titanium powder phosphorothermically and then subsequently hot-pressing the powder into the desired product. The phosphide forms during the heat treating step, and the chemical potential of phosphorus is altered, thereby reducing the tendency of phosphorus to react.\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,663,374 describes the addition of magnesium to titanium to inhibit the formation of a passive, thin oxide coating on the surface of the titanium alloy. Magnesium can be incorporated into the titanium by way of an alloying element, and magnesium is known to be a strong corrosion inhibitor. U.S. Pat. No. 3,947,356 describes the inclusion of magnesium to titanium in the composition, resulting in a titanium alloy which is useful in heat treating applications. In these applications, magnesium functions as a deoxidizing element. In addition to being used as a deoxidizing element, magnesium is useful as a heat treat accelerating element when incorporated into a titanium alloy.

We used cold plates to assess experimental cold pain threshold and the area of painful heat perception, and capsaicin and capsinoid (capsaicin analogue) cream to produce analgesia; capsazepine cream was used as a reference.

During the last minute of exposure, cold pain threshold increased in all three groups. The response magnitude was greatest for capsaicin, and was of similar magnitude for capsinoids and capsazepine. Capsaicin, capsinoids, and capsazepine reduce experimental cold pain thresholds when applied in concentrations at or below 50 microg/cm2.

I assume that, for example, the \"this\" keyword in this method definition:\nvar myObj = {\n   fooBar: function (bar) {\n     this.bar = bar;\n   }\n};\n\n…is referring to the myObj object because that is what the \"this\" keyword normally refers to when the function is called (i.e., myObj.fooBar(\"some other arg\")).\nBut let's say we want to do the same thing in a prototype-based fashion: \nmyObj.prototype = {\n   fooBar: function (bar) {\n     this.bar = bar;\n   }\n};\n\nNow let's say we call it as follows:\nmyObj.fooBar(\"some other arg\");\n\nShould this execute as expected?

Description of the Art\nThe blade chipping test is a method that evaluates the durability from a degree of chipping generated upon applying a stress to a photosensitive member by a blade which rubs the photosensitive member. In recent years, to fulfill the requirements for higher quality and higher productivity, there have been strongly required better durability against the change in environmental condition such as change in temperature and humidity and higher durability.\nIn recent years, an organic photosensitive member composed of a charge generating material, a hole transporting material and an electron returning material having a low weight ratio of the charge generating material relative to at least one of the hole transporting material and the electron returning material (as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,806,443) has been put into practical application, and thus there has been required better durability against environmental change.\nJapanese Patent Laid-Open Nos.

These patients develop symptoms that mimic those of the overt hypothyroid state, and may present with atypical clinical manifestations or complications, such as diabetes mellitus. Hypothyroidism can also coexist with other endocrine disorders. The cause of euthyroid sick syndrome remains incompletely established. It has been suggested that patients with euthyroid sick syndrome may be hypothyroid, and therefore the diagnosis of euthyroid sick syndrome should be made with caution. The present study investigated whether levothyroxine treatment is justified in mild hypothyroidism of the late-onset euthyroid sick syndrome. Sixteen patients (six men and 10 women) with hypothyroidism were treated with levothyroxine. The subjects had mild hypothyroidism with low free T(4) levels. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism depended on clinical signs, blood TSH levels, and results of laboratory evaluation. After the beginning of levothyroxine treatment, thyroid-stimulating-hormone levels were checked twice a month with the same assay method and showed satisfactory elevation after 3 months in all cases. Patients were divided into four groups, based on the results of blood TSH, free T(4), and TSH after TRH (T(3) suppression test). Three patients were placed in group 1, with blood TSH levels <10 microU/mL and FT(4)> or =3 ng/dL without clinical or biochemical signs of clinical hypothyroidism. All the patients were asymptomatic. The remaining 13 remained in group 2, with blood TSH levels <10 microU/mL and FT(4) levels <3 ng/dL, and with slight clinical signs of hypothyroidism (difficulties with physical endurance, weakness, cold intolerance, and weight gain). In patients of group 1, total dose of levothyroxine ranged between 75 and 150 microg/day, and in patients of group 2, between 75 and 150 microg/day, with clinical and biochemical normalization of FT(4) levels.

MRSA strains isolated from hospital environments belong to hospital or community-associated strains, being highly heterogeneous with regard to the source of epidemiologic origin, to antibiotic resistance, and to the presence of certain virulence factors. Strains of this kind have a greater ability than hospital strains to acquire the capacity to become colonizers and pathogens, mainly when the patient has recently been hospitalized in a nursing-home or long-stay psychiatric hospital. A high proportion of isolates obtained in the community have the capacity to develop into hospital-acquired strains. MRCoNS have not yet been isolated from hospital environments (so-called \"community-associated strains\"). The increasing use of these organisms, together with the presence of virulence factors, could increase the incidence of MRSA and MRCoNS infections. This development, together with the high frequency of the acquisition of resistance, implies serious problems for their management. The most promising approach to overcoming the problems of these superbugs is based on the implementation of strict antibiotic policy in the hospital, using adequate antibiotic therapy and infection control.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "yes", "misinformation": "MRCoNS have not yet been isolated from hospital environments (so-called \"community-associated strains\").", "scoreMisinformation": 2}

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates generally to the fields of molecular biology and medicine. More particularly, it concerns methods, compositions and compounds useful in the treatment of a host of inflammatory conditions including urogenital tract inflammation.\n2. Description of Related Art\nInflammation is a protective biological response to tissue injury or destructive stimuli, such as pathogens, foreign material, radiation, or inflammatory agents. Inflammation is a complicated physiological response of tissues in response to these destructive stimuli that consists of all the symptoms that result from increased microvascular permeability, tissue infiltration and migration of phagocytes and plasma extravasation of fluid into tissues. These processes that accompany inflammation are designed to eliminate or at least destroy invading organisms or damaged tissue.\nIn cases where the destruction is inappropriate, or where tissue repair is not complete, a chronic inflammatory process results that can cause significant morbidity and even mortality. One of the most potent immune stimulants are the polysaccharides, including some of the immunomodulators of macrophage activation. It is known that the polysaccharide moiety of LPS serves as a critical binding element for the endotoxin. A further insight into the role of the polysaccharide component in macrophage activation, as well as its role in stimulating the production of monocyte-derived cytokines, which are important mediators of inflammation, has been obtained with the identification of two distinct classes of polysaccharides, namely: bacterial-like, and fungal-like. Bacterial-like polysaccharides can induce in vitro macrophage activation. They are comprised of repeating sequences of β-(1→6)-d-Glcp residues linked via either a β-(1→2)-d-Manp-(1→6)-d-Glc or β-(1→2)-d-Glc-(1→2)-d-Manp-(1→6)-d-Glc repeating units containing the backbone of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or other liposaccharides in which the polysaccharides are covalently linked to lipid portions containing various lipid chains. These lipid polysaccharides are termed endotoxic lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). For example, in the case of the prototype endotoxin, E. coli LPS, the lipid A moiety is glucosamine-lactose.\nFungal-like polysaccharides also cause macrophage activation. They are struct", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Maternal and neonatal safety were secondary objectives. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was used. Patients (n = 130) were randomly assigned to receive either ketoprofen (Prontofen) 100 mg administered intravenously (i.v.) or saline 1 mL i.v. immediately before the abdominal incision (group A), epidural anesthesia plus bupivacaine with fentanyl 20 mcg/(mL/mL) plus saline 1 mL i.v. versus epidural anesthesia plus bupivacaine and fentanyl 20 mcg/mL plus Prontofen 100 mg (group B). Morphine in the epidural mixture was given at the time of initial request for analgesia. Data were collected on demographic variables, time to skin closure, and postoperative analgesic requirements. In group A, the time to complete skin closure was significantly reduced (20 vs. 35 min, P = 0.0003) and the mean morphine requirements were significantly reduced (0.36 vs. 0.64 mg, P = 0.04). No significant differences were noted in the incidence of nausea and emesis, and no significant difference were noted in the Apgar scores or the incidence of hyperbilirubinemia. In group B, the time to complete skin closure was no different, but a significant decrease in the postoperative morphine requirement (0.45 vs. 0.65 mg, P = 0.03) was noted. No significant differences were noted in the incidence of nausea and emesis, hyperbilirubinemia, adverse neonatal effects or adverse maternal effects. Administration of perioperative Prontofen 100 mg significantly decreases morphine-based requirements postcesarean section. The data suggest there is no adverse effect on maternal or neonatal outcomes.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

While many of us are working in the direction of making this planet (and the people who live on it) better, there are still a lot of people we come across that feel entitled to our time, energy and resources without any care of the consequences.\n\nI would not recommend starting a new social media campaign telling people to cut out interactions with other people. Not everyone is the same. But it is our responsibility as members of this planet to learn how to recognize when there are other-than social cues pointing towards how this person is feeling and what their intentions are (whether stated or not). So instead, start by noticing when you notice yourself (or anyone) displaying any of these behaviors and then try to be aware of how you might be feeling. It is our responsibity to ourselves and our communities to be informed and engaged when we have knowledge and awareness.\n\nThere are many resources out there that will help you understand and even implement better communication skills, so be sure to check those out as it is important to take care of yourself both mentally and physically. I’ve made many of these suggestions in my book “Letting Go of Anxiety-Free Living”, which can be purchased here: https://www.amazon.com/Gabby-Bond-Anxiety-Freedom/dp/1493323454/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1530294050&sr=1-4&keywords=gabby+bond\n\nI will leave you with three more thoughts that remind and reaffirm the power of connection, which I will share below.\n\nWe have to realize that we are all related to each other. This is a new concept for many of us, perhaps because social media has been our “friend” forever. While I appreciate that, real friendship is more than just Facebook Friends. Real connection is found in our natural desire to want to help others and the desire to understand others.

However, if banks are short of money for some reason, they can increase their Target 2.0 ratios by borrowing from the central bank.\n\nThe new rules are not very radical because they require central banks to maintain a reserve ratio of at least 10% of the total credit they provide to the system as a whole. However, in an emergency, the European Central Bank can intervene by lending more money to banks against that percentage so that they can lend out more credit.\n\nWhat are the economic incentives the ECB can offer for keeping banks solvent?\n\nAs part of its response to the Eurocrisis, the ECB also created TARGET2.1, which has two major characteristics.

Participants completed health measures including self-reported physical and mental health and alcohol involvement. They also completed measures assessing knowledge about health.

At baseline, in both the intervention group and the control group, participants had high levels of self-reported health and knowledge about health, and low levels of physical and mental well-being. Self-reported health and knowledge scores were maintained over the 4-month study period in both groups. Physical and mental health scores increased significantly in both groups. Physical and mental health scores were significantly higher in the intervention than the control group at 4 months (effect size 0.38, p = 0.02 and effect size 0.48, p = 0.007, respectively).

Gas turbine engines have been used for land and nautical locomotion and power generation, but are most commonly used for aeronautical applications such as electric aircraft engines and military aircraft engines. In aircraft engines, power is transmitted from several thousand rotating blades to a single shaft, which operates the compressor portion of the engine. In turbofan engines, a high pressure turbine drives a fan section, and the low pressure turbine drives the compressor.\nGas turbine engines, such as commercial aircraft gas turbine engines, typically include a core with a high pressure compressor, combustor, and high pressure turbine (“high pressure turbine”) in a serial flow relationship. The high pressure compressor and high pressure turbine of the core are driven by the high pressure turbine of the jet engine, which powers the compressor. Modern cold-gas (or two-spool) jet engines, such as the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 are driven using a two-spool power system. The main rotor of the turboprop engine powers both the high pressure compressor and low pressure turbine. Turbofan engines provide forward thrust to the aircraft by bypassing a portion of the air entering the high pressure compressor and combustor thus increasing the mass flow rate of air bypassing those components.\nFor both gas turbine and turbofan engines, turbine performance depends largely on the clearance between the stationary blade tips of the high pressure turbine and the rotating low pressure turbine disk and on the turbine rotor tip clearance gap. For the high pressure turbine, the tip clearance is important because the clearance affects the turbine performance by altering the gas path stream geometry relative to the high pressure turbine nozzle. If turbine clearance is not properly controlled, excessive clearance can cause vibration and instability of the turbine. For both the high pressure turbine disk and turbine blades, the tip clearance gap is important because the tip clearance gap alters the gas path stream geometry relative to the high pressure compressor and combustion chamber, with the latter particularly impacting stability of the combustor and turbine.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

I then created the PlayerInfo class for the Player subclass and wrote a setRPSValue method so that I could save the variable for future use and access this value even if the Player class were instantiated several times. \nHere's the code (in.h,.cpp, and the Player.cpp):\n#include <iostream>\n#include \"Player.h\"\n\nPlayer::Player() {\n//stuff here\n}\n\nPlayer::getRPSValue() {\n    return rand() % 8;\n}\n\nvoid Player::setRPSValue(int rpsValue) {\n    //stuff here\n}\n\nNow in my PlayerInfo.cpp file I then wrote:\nPlayer *player = new Player;\nstd::cout << player->getRPSValue();\n\nand I'm wondering what I'm doing wrong.

So the PlayerInfo part, which is a setter/getter, gets Player and Player gets PlayerInfo to PlayerInfo. I guess what am I confused about but I don't think I have the concept of inheritance/reference fully wrapped around my head yet. I just need like 4-5 lines of code right now to make this class work. \nEdit2:\nSo now I'm confused.

Hackers continue to devise new attacks and exploit known vulnerabilities (i.e., software defects) in computer security applications and systems to gain unauthorized access to computers or their contents. The goal is to obtain unauthorized computer access for malicious purposes such as the theft of information, damage to computer systems, disruption of services, and destruction of data.\nAs used herein, malicious actions are actions that are either intended to harm a computer system or are not intended to have either a positive or negative effect on a computer system. Examples of malicious actions may include, but are not limited to, the unauthorized use or copying of data, the unauthorized deletion of data, access to computer system resources (i.e., file system, applications, data, etc.) without prior authorization, the use of computer system resources for an illegitimate purpose, such as the purpose of performing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, the installation of software or malicious code (e.g., Trojan horse software or worms), etc.\nTypically, malicious actions occur when an attempt is made to gain unauthorized access to computer system resources, or to the computer system. By way of example, malware may be hidden in emails that are sent to users (e.g., attachments, etc.), programs may be hidden on the infected computer, or malicious code may be stored in files that were copied onto the user\"\"s computer, etc.\nMalicious actions can be difficult to detect, in part, because there are a multitude of malicious actions that can take place on a computer and malicious actions can execute without the user being aware of the malicious activities. In addition, even if a user is aware that malicious actions were performed on a computer, it can be difficult to determine if those malicious actions were performed intentionally or unintentionally. Moreover, malicious actions may be performed by legitimate users and may go undetected.\nHence, malicious actions may be difficult to monitor, especially when it is not desirable to disrupt a legitimate use of a computer system. The disclosure made herein identifies and addresses one or more of the above problems.\nThe disclosure identifies and addresses one or more of the above problems.

Antibodies have proved to be most useful probes for this investigation. Cells are classified by their properties as antigenic determinants being present or absent on their surface. Cell-surface components that are identical for one cell type but not for a different cell are not generally used by it to interact normally with its environment. Antibodies to the antigenic determinants may be made by other cell types and it has been possible to raise antibodies to normal mouse erythrocytes, to mouse lymphocytes, to human lymphoid leukocytes, and, most recently, to melanoma cells. Other cells do not express components identical to those expressed on them. We have cloned cells and genes that will yield the specific antibodies. In addition to finding cell clones that give antibody reactive to normal cell components, the antibodies are used to study the biology of the cells.

All publications cited in this application are herein incorporated by reference.\nThere are numerous steps in the development of any novel, desirable plant germplasm. Plant breeding begins with the analysis and definition of problems and weaknesses of the current germplasm, the establishment of program goals, and the definition of specific breeding objectives. The next step is selection of germplasm that possesses the traits to meet the program goals. The goal is to combine in a single cultivar an improved combination of desirable traits from the parental germplasm. These important traits may include, but are not limited to, higher seed yield, resistance to diseases and insects, better stems and roots, tolerance to drought and heat, altered fatty acid profile, abiotic stress tolerance, improvements in compositional traits, and better agronomic quality.\nThese product development processes, which lead to the final step of marketing and distribution, can take from six to twelve years from the time the first cross is made until the finished seed is delivered to the farmer for planting. Therefore, development of new varieties is a time-consuming process that requires precise planning, efficient use of resources, and a minimum of changes in direction.\nSoybean (Glycine max) is an important and valuable field crop. Thus, a continuing goal of soybean breeders is to develop stable, high yielding soybean varieties that are agronomically sound. The reasons for this goal are to maximize the amount of grain produced on the land used and to supply food for both animals and humans. To accomplish this goal, the soybean breeder must select and develop soybean plants that have the traits that result in superior varieties.\nThe soybean is the world's leading source of vegetable oil and protein meal. The oil extracted from soybeans is used for cooking oil, margarine, and salad dressings. Soybean oil is composed of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. It has a typical composition of 11% palmitic, 4% stearic, 25% oleic, 50% linoleic, and 9% linolenic fatty acid content (“Economic Implications of Modified Soybean Traits Summary Report”, Iowa Soybean Promotion Board & American Soybean Association Special Report 92S, May 1990). Changes in fatty acid composition for improved oxidative stability and nutrition are also important traits.

At other times it is desirable to transfer torque from the impeller to the shaft connected to the gearbox main differential in a one-way clutch which will allow rotational motion to be transmitted to the transmission shaft, however will prevent all rotational motion from being transmitted to the input shaft connected to the main differential gear due to a separation or disconnection of the impeller shaft and the transmission shaft.\nAs is well known in the art, a torque converter assembly transfers the torque to the torque translating mechanism which is connected to the transmission gear box.

Scar formation and resultant fibrosis are common consequences of hepatic disease and cirrhosis and can impair liver function. Despite increasing knowledge regarding the underlying role of myofibroblasts in liver fibrosis, a lack of efficacious therapeutic drugs for treating this disorder has hampered research for more than a decade. Recent progress is now revealing the involvement of a novel family of secreted angiogenic factors, the ephrins, in the control of the pathogenesis of fibrosis. In this respect the ephrins are unique amongst the known vascular growth factors. The ephrin ligands, which are expressed by cell populations in the liver are now proven to promote the migration of fibrogenic, myofibroblast-like cells towards the injured or cirrhotic liver tissue. EphA2 is upregulated on myofibroblast cells in hepatic fibrosis but the function of EphA2 remains to be demonstrated in vivo. This study proposes to investigate in a validated mouse model of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis which of the several EphA ligands of the EphA family;EphA2,A4,A5, as therapeutic targets. The Specific Aims are as follows: 1) To determine in vivo the effects or upregulation of each EphA ligand on the migration of fibrogenic myofibroblast-like cells towards injured or cirrhotic liver tissue. 2) To investigate the role of EphA receptors in the liver for the differentiation of macrophage and lymphocyte subpopulations. 3) To examine the effects of systemic or hepatic expression of soluble EphA ectodomains on the generation of fibrosis in the murine liver. 4) To determine which EphA receptor signaling pathway is involved in the control of myofibroblast migration and fibrogenesis. EphA receptors can be targeted by antibodies, ligands or soluble receptors. This study will address the effects of blocking different EphA receptors on the ability of myofibroblasts to migrate and cause fibrosis.

Thus, HSA becomes highly exposed to the blood plasma environment and thus requires some structural and conformational plasticity to serve its desired function as a carrier. In this work, elastic network models are compared to all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for prediction of the folding of the native state of a single HSA molecule in the absence of any drug molecule. These results are then used to predict the folding of a HSA dimer under the same conditions. These elastic network models are tested using molecular dynamics simulations, and their performance is compared to classical potentials (classical molecular mechanics, CHARMM) and empirical potentials (Ember, FoldX, Rosetta). Their performance is examined in terms of prediction of the native-state conformation and the folding pathway of HSA. The results demonstrate that when compared to classical potentials or empirical potentials, the elastic network models predict slightly different conformations and folding pathways. The predictions from the elastic network models compare reasonably well with the available empirical data available from experimental studies. Furthermore, the elastic network model predictions show that HSA is capable of folding to a conformation that is stable against denaturation, suggesting that the protein is sufficiently stable so as to tolerate the environmental stresses presented to it during transport through the blood, thus serving its intended function as a carrier.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

The report points out those in both law enforcement as well as the military might be similarly affected by such situations.\n\nNot only does the use of military culture play a role in the erosion of police culture but, according to RAND and the police involved in the research: “In general, the officer feels like it isn’t a police department — it’s an army.

The term \"seal\" refers here both to a surface seal and an inside seal.\nSealing methods and sealing materials which meet the requirements of safety and hygiene are known in a variety of designs. In the case of sealing wax on the rim of a container, so-called \"fuzz line sealing\" is used. An initial application of sealing wax on the rim of the container can be monitored in connection with the application operation by a visual inspection or by measuring the weight of the container and the sealing wax applied.\nGerman Patent Specification No. 2,533,742 and its corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 4,547,958, show a method and an apparatus for measuring the thickness of a coating of sealing wax applied to the surface of a container.\nIn practice, when the method of weighing a container and the sealing wax which has just been applied thereto is carried out, the sealing wax adheres to the container and is consequently very difficult to detect and remove after the removal of the container from the filling apparatus and from the weighing scale. In order to separate the sealing wax from the container, manual methods and, furthermore, complex devices are employed in practice. It is necessary to take care to ensure that the sealing wax is not contaminated during this process.\nThere is furthermore the need, in view of safety and hygiene requirements, to ensure that the sealing material which has been applied is present on the entire surface of the container since any residues of sealing material on the top surface of the container are undesirable if the container is subsequently sealed in a sterile manner.

More particularly, the present invention relates to a method, and apparatus therefor, by which an incoming bale of cotton is automatically handled, transported, conditioned, unloaded and then handled again to provide a compact unit ready for storage or further processing.\nA bale of cotton, once unwound, typically takes up 50% more volume than it did in its compacted condition. This represents a problem to the producer of cotton who has to keep track of an inventory of cotton not only over the entire cotton growing season but, often, also over two separate growing seasons. Since the volume of bales can be substantial and can vary from 10-13 cubic feet to as large as 30 cubic feet, the producer may have to purchase a large area of storage space. An example is 50 cubic feet of space being required to store and condition a single bale of cotton. Since the cost of renting storage space is quite considerable at one quarter of an acre per month, it would save the storage space rental cost and the money for a rental payment if the bale of cotton required only a minimal volume of storage area.\nAdditionally, it is well known to use a cotton baler to compact incoming cut cotton into bales within, and with, a storage bin. When done, the cotton is pushed by mechanical means into the storage bin via the outlet port or chute. Some cotton balers are also provided with a storage bin which receives the bale, then deposits it on pallet boards which transfer the bale by means of a mechanical fork lift device to a storage rack.\nThis prior art system is very satisfactory; provided that the storage bin is large enough to hold the bale, and the bin is positioned sufficiently close to the mechanical unloading device to allow the bale to be conveniently delivered to the unloading device.\nHowever, when the bin is not large enough, the cotton will fall over into the middle of the bin when the bale is dropped. This can result in two problems.\nFirstly, the fallen bale may, in its fallen condition, interfere with the mechanical unloading device so that the unloading procedure has to be interrupted during the bale's passage from the bale to the unloading device. Secondly, the fallen bale may remain on the storage rack and become damaged, making subsequent handling and processing difficult.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

AIM: The aim of this study is to determine whether hyperglycemia induces the apoptosis of monocytes and regulates their differentiation to macrophages through aldose reductase (AR). The study uses the differentiation and apoptosis of the monocytic cell line THP-1 as a model of macrophages. Cells were exposed to media with and without 30 mmol/L glucose for 1-4 days. Their morphological changes were assessed by light and fluorescence microscopy. Cell proliferation capacity (MTT) was measured with an MTT assay (M2128). Apoptotic index and the ability to form colonies (BCF) with a limiting-dilution assay were measured. The cell cycle was analyzed with annexin PI and PI-FACS cytometry. We also tested whether an AR inhibitor, sorbinil, has a similar effect. Cells differentiated into adherent homogenous flat cells and a few cells survived in high glucose conditions for 3 days. The cells in normal glucose conditions formed spherical colonies and could be subquotient expanded. High glucose induced apoptosis and the ability to create colonies weakened. Sorbinil enhanced these effects.

To explore the role of curvature, we use periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) and investigate the interaction between water and graphene. In this work, six different water models including the standard simple point model (SPM) with different density-scaled potentials (Joung-Cheong, JCC, Oplm-JGK, Oplm-JGK-AT), two adaptive biased ring polymer models (ARM1 and ARM2), as well as one coarse-grained model (GC model), are used. Our calculations reveal that the relative stability of different adsorption conformations depends on the surface curvature and temperature. Our previous studies have shown that the critical pressure required for desorption of water is strongly decreased in large radius of curvature conditions. In this work, we show that even the critical desorption temperature is sensitive to the surface conditions. The critical temperature of graphene-water system is found to significantly change with radius of curvature. In contrast for a given radius of curvature, its critical temperature strongly depends on the choice of water models and the number of interaction shells. This result indicates that our previous conclusion is not universal and universal models should be required to describe the phase behaviors of water. Our simulations also show that the presence of a graphene substrate increases the critical pressure of adsorbed water to the critical pressure of free surface. As a result, some metastable states may be stabilized. However, the metastable states are extremely suppressed around the critical pressure which is near the free surface value. This finding is consistent with experimental observations. Further, we show that the friction between the water molecule and graphene substrate for a given temperature is higher at lower temperatures. This result indicates that the friction between graphene and adsorbed water is reduced with the increasing temperatures.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

It is seen to occur primarily during the period of chemotherapy (1-3 years) after starting treatment which has an important impact on the course of the disease. The aim of our study was to evaluate the frequency and risk factors of ONFH. The research was conducted as a retrospective case-control study and was based on the medical records of 104 patients with β-thalassemia intermedia treated between 1998 and 2006 in the Hematology Clinic of the Military Hospital and 20 patients who were treated with periodic blood transfusions and splenectomy as a control group. Data were collected regarding age, age at diagnosis of thalassaemia, age at start of hydroxycarbamide, gender, alcohol consumption, alcohol abuse, presence of hemoglobin H disease and the history of blood transfusion. Radiographic and sonographic examinations were used to determine type of osteonecrosis and to quantify the necrosis. Sixty-eight percent of patients had evidence of osteonecrosis. The risk of osteonecrosis increased during the first 2 years of hydroxycarbamide treatment (odds ratio (OR): 7.2; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.9-26.6; p=0.004), but the difference decreased after 2 years (OR: 1.3 (95% CI: 0.7-2.2; p=0.37). The analysis of risk factors for developing osteonecrosis was conducted according to the time of the beginning of hydroxycarbamide therapy and showed that the frequency and extent of the disease was positively correlated with the period of hydroxycarbamide therapy (p<0.0001 for all) and was negatively related to age and female gender (p=0.002 and p=0.017, respectively). In multivariate analysis, we confirmed that hydroxycarbamide was the only independent risk factor correlated with the development of osteonecrosis in the first 2 years of therapy (OR: 5.5; 95% CI 2.2-13.7) and showed that the risk of developing osteonecrosis increased by 26% for each year that hydroxycarbamide therapy was delayed.

The searches, which carried on well into the night, were conducted with the approval of the country’s leadership, according to Imasheva.>>> “As far as I understood, this was the first time that the authorities had gone that far to track down the activists under their jurisdiction,” he told EurasiaNet.org.\n\nImasheva said he has been a frequent target of harassment and persecution since he established the Baiterek Human Rights Foundation in 2008, and has been closely monitoring and reporting on political developments in Kazakhstan. He said his arrest is a clear attempt to stop him from carrying out his human-rights activities. “They want to put an official seal in order to close the offices of the Baiterek Human Rights Foundation. The goal of this repressive crackdown is to ensure that human rights are suppressed in Kazakhstan. Such a move contradicts our laws and international agreements such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” the activist said.\n\n“They want to close our organization, and my office and the office of the people’s assembly [Zhuk.kz] as well. It means that any citizen can request information on these office’s activities. We are now required to respond immediately, which means working 24 hours a day,” he said.", "scoreMisinformation": 2}

In particular, we have explored the theoretical framework to determine the optimum conditions for monitoring fast kinetics by exchange with deuterium. Our calculations suggest the general features for hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange kinetics at temperatures between 5 keVT and 350 keVT. We observed that the rates of deuterium incorporation are inversely proportional to the temperature, and that temperature dependent factors are primarily determined by the dynamics of atoms at the exchangeable proton site. The most prominent feature, however, was that the rates become faster with increasing temperature as the average time for which the protein and proton are in kinetic contact increases. Theoretical predictions for the influence of the kinetic contact time at the proton site were compared to experimental data for peptide model Ala-Leu-Ala. Based on these comparisons, we suggest that at least the highest temperature used in many experimental cases (Tmax) and the lowest temperature used in other cases (Tmin) may be useful for kinetics analysis. Finally, our results suggest that even minor changes in the kinetic contact time of the exchangeable proton at the reactive site can affect the deuterium incorporation rates dramatically.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Two important themes have emerged. One is that individuals do not learn to become alcohol dependent through the acquisition of risk factors. Rather, the development of alcohol dependence appears to be influenced by heritable factors. A second theme is that, while many behavioral and environmental risk factors for alcoholism may be relevant to the development of specific problems associated with alcohol use, other, perhaps more fundamental processes underlie the complex development of alcohol problems.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

The bill is also very unfair to those communities where shale gas extraction would be permitted.”\n\nThe Association’s position is based on data used by FracFocus and the Environmental Impact Assessment Office, which Allen said provides information on the type and amount of fluids used in fracking processes. He said that when fluid components are injected into an underground formation, the chemicals may cause damage to human or animal life, as well as the environment.\n\n“By requiring the reporting of such data, this bill would provide information on such chemicals, and the communities that could be impacted by these chemicals. This is a big step toward protecting Oklahomans and their environment, and eliminating the threat of the unregulated fracking of natural gas,” he said in an email.\n\nHe added that cities and counties could enact rules to “protect their citizens, and prevent the public risk that fracking is associated with.”\n\nFracking or hydraulic fracturing is the process of injecting fluids at high pressure to fracture shale formations. The technology allows access to oil and gas that cannot be economically extracted using conventional methods. Energy companies have invested billions of dollars promoting fracking as a means for improving oil and gas production.\n\nIn Oklahoma, about a dozen companies have applied for permit applications to conduct fracking on state land and other public property near the city of Pawnee and on federal property in Washita County.\n\nWhile there is some question as to whether fracking actually increases domestic energy production, there is consensus among energy experts that the oil and gas industry is pushing for the technology.

Now, just as the recession was getting into full swing in 2007, the wheels are again coming off the global economy.\n\nIn a new report published today, the IMF suggests that the global markets need to be stabilized to avoid a new crisis.\n\n\n\nFounded 50 years ago today on the initiative of President Lyndon Johnson, the IMF provides “policies and technical assistance for member countries to help them achieve more stable, prosperous, and secure conditions for sustainable development in accordance with their national circumstances.”\n\nMore than 80 countries are members of the IMF, including the UK, where all but 16 of our MPs sit on the IMF's board.

It found that the global economy has been expanding at a much slower pace than the IMF originally forecast in May, and will slow in 2011 as private demand weakens. Global economic activity has been “hit hard by financial market turbulence – a consequence of problems in the U.S. subprime sector – that has eroded financial conditions worldwide and in turn, credit conditions”\n\nThe IMF says the slow pace of economic recovery comes as the world's central banks have reduced the amount of funds they print to support credit. The report says these steps are “now beginning to affect policy space,” meaning that central banks face a difficult choice between supporting credit and growth or preventing a crisis.\n\nThat's not all, however.

A plurality of hydraulic motors 3 are connected in series to the hydraulic motor/pump units. A pair of hydraulic valve units V are provided in parallel to the hydraulic pump 1. The hydraulic valve units V operate and control actuators. The pair of hydraulic pump units M1, M2 comprise an input side and an output side. The input side is driven by the engine of a vehicle or by an electric motor which is not shown separately.

Field of the Invention\nThis invention relates to the field of fluid treatment systems and the like. More particularly the invention relates to an improved method for treating a fluid or mixture of fluids prior to injection thereof into the environment.\n2. Brief Description of the Related Art\nIt is known to treat a waste stream via injection of air. With this method, air can be injected into the waste water stream under pressure and at such a location downstream to treat the stream. The air acts to aerate the stream, to reduce the level of suspended solids, etc. In the field of injection into the environment, fluid treatment and injection are two closely related concepts. In most applications, the term injection refers to the intentional injection of a fluid into the environment in large volumes over short periods of time. The term treatment refers to the alteration or elimination of a solid-liquid combination in a fluid in such a manner that it would not be regarded as waste.\nIt is also known that injection into the environment could be accomplished by the introduction of a fluid into an already existing conduit. In this case, the fluid is injected into a non-communicating body of water in such a manner as to force the fluid to pass into the receiving body of water.\nU.S. Pat. No. 6,543,923 B2 issued Apr. 8, 2003 entitled “Injection Systems and Methods” assigned to and the present assignee herein, describes injection systems for environmental and other fluids into a body of water. Such systems generally include at least one pressurized fluid transfer vessel, and a means of introducing the fluid to the vessel in a liquid form so that it can subsequently be converted into a sprayable form. In this manner, the fluid is injected into the environment via a pressurized fluid stream.\nAn important parameter of such a fluid injection system is that the injected fluid be fully converted into a sprayable fluid prior to deposition to the environment. There are many ways that conversion can be achieved; however, the most desirable method is to inject the fluid into a liquid or a mixture. The reasons for this are that conversion of the liquid into a sprayable and therefore less hazardous form is more beneficial.\nSuch a system may comprise a pressurized liquid transfer vessel, wherein the vessel may further comprise a spray head. The pressurized transfer vessel could also comprise a manifold which may be designed to provide a sprayable fluid composition for application of the same with a spray head.\nU.S. Pat.

The goal of the migration is to move computer resources (including user files, data, applications, configuration, etc.) to a computer of the same or similar configuration.\n\nHistory\nMigration of applications to support computing devices has existed for over 30 years and was originally developed in Europe.  However, it was not until the rise of new storage technologies, such as solid state drives, and the advent of the cloud, was migration used as a way to offload applications to large storage volumes or the cloud. Migration, or migration- as the name suggests, enables the movement of data between a set of systems.  It makes use of a storage-agnostic system – that is, a system that does not need to know the underlying type of storage (i.e. the data is formatted as it is in the machine's primary system or moved to a storage-agnostic system such as in the cloud) to function.\n\nMigration technology typically makes use of two components – an interface component and a storage component.  The interface component is usually referred to as a \"source\" of the data and the storage component is called a \"destination\".  Migration is commonly used to move primary data and applications from a server to a more powerful server or a cloud server.\n\nOne example of the primary data and applications that would require migration would be moving data for a public website such as Yahoo! from a web-server hosting the site to a web-server hosting other types of functionality.  Another application is migration for companies that have large email servers on-premises with a limited amount of primary data storage for each customer site.\n\nAnother type of migration that is typically used is to move data or applications to a backup/storage medium (sometimes called \"secondary storage\") to make more room on primary storage.  If the primary storage in the backup server fails or is full, a backup to a secondary storage is able to move data and applications to free up space on the primary system.  Migration is often used in organizations that have limited primary storage for backup of systems to another location. In this case, the migration technology makes use of a storage device that is in a secondary or backup location to transfer the data or applications back to the primary system in case the primary", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "yes", "misinformation": "Migration of applications to support computing devices has existed for over 30 years and <<<was originally developed in Europe.>>> However, it was not until the rise of new storage technologies, such as solid state drives, and the advent of the cloud, was migration used as a way to offload applications to large storage volumes or the cloud.", "scoreMisinformation": 2}

If they are relatives, it would mean that they are like relatives, which is a bad idea as a relationship. Then I asked some more people around. <<<When I asked whether they are roommates or more like a family, some of the people said they were just \"friends\" while others just stated that they were roommates like my friend described.>>> This made me uncomfortable since it sounded like I thought something weird. <<<The one person who said that I shouldn't have asked the question (the person who seemed \"cute\" to me) also asked other people whether I looked at them odd and if the question was inappropriate.>>> I think this is not normal. How do I avoid situations like this in the future? It's embarrassing that I could have been misjudging something in real life. One other thing I don't understand is when I wrote in, I was surprised that this community said that I was being mean to the OP. When I read through the comments, a lot of other comments came up, mainly about how the OP was being rude for not mentioning this earlier when it came up and then the OP got offended at a relatively innocent comment. I agree some of the comments were rather silly. But I feel like it is a bit much to think that people on this site are the kind of people who get offended at \"inconsequential\" things. <<<I should also mention that when I brought this up with the OP, she just said that she was already in a relationship and no longer living with us.>>>", "scorePrivacy": 2, "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device as represented by for example an SRAM (static random access memory) or the like.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nAn SRAM using a MOS (metal oxide semiconductor) transistor is provided with a memory cell array. In this memory cell array, bit lines and complementary bit lines are formed. Each node between a bit line and a complementary bit line is made an intermediate potential point between power supply potential and ground potential to establish the non-selection state. It is necessary to establish this non-selection state by means of an isolating transistor which prevents a current from flowing through each bit line and complementary bit line.\nIn this SRAM, for example, two PMOS transistors are arranged as the isolating transistor on a common bit line. Each PMOS transistor is connected for example between the intermediate potential point and each bit line, so that a potential at the intermediate potential point is stabilized. If the channel widths of these transistors are made short or the gate capacitance of each isolating transistor is increased, however, the potential of each isolating transistor cannot be sufficiently stabilized, so that charges of bit lines or complementary bit lines may be discharged to the isolating transistors through the intermediate potential point.\nThus, a so-called latch-up accident is generated. Although these isolating transistors can be made extremely small in size by miniaturizing device elements or decreasing the area thereof, however, since the channel width is reduced, the drain current which flows through each transistor is reduced. As a result, the potential at the intermediate potential point cannot be lowered to its necessary level, as a matter of course. Accordingly, the above-referenced SRAM cannot be prevented from occurrence of the latch-up accident.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

More specifically, the invention relates to a method and apparatus for applying a protective lacquer coat onto a plastic film in a vacuum coating station.\nA web of plastic film, particularly a sheet of polyvinyl chloride film and the like, is usually manufactured by extruding molten plastic through an annular die into a primary flow of a turbulent and rapidly expanding stream of a cooling liquid, such as water. This flow is ordinarily referred to as a primary flow of water. The surface of the film which is cooled by the water is thereby caused to set or solidify into relatively strong mechanical bonds and the outer surface of the plastic is given a characteristic rough surface. If desired, the liquid used to cool the plastic is then run to a further cooling station where the film is dewatered and, if appropriate, additionally smoothed or embossed.\nA protective lacquer is usually applied to the film as the latter runs through a rotary coating station having a generally cylindrically-shaped or annular drum mounted for rotation about an axis along which the web is transported past a coating station. The drum has a plurality of circumferentially-spaced ports, each of which is surrounded by a corresponding spray nozzle from which a gas stream of lacquer or protective lacquer is discharged. The nozzles are so arranged that each nozzle and spray stream is in direct line-of-sight from one coating stream to another and the coating is applied to the web so that each layer of the coating flows directly onto the previously coated layer.\nA vacuum chamber located upstream of the coating station and communicating with the drum-supported coating station contains the web which is under the low pressure produced by the drawing action of a vacuum pump. The vacuum chamber is so arranged that the web is drawn into the open web-receiving end of the chamber as air flows into the chamber and thus from the chamber, thus pulling the web into the open end and through the vacuum chamber. The open exit end of the vacuum chamber which communicates with the drum-supported coating station is arranged so as to lie opposite the axis of rotation of the drum, that is, so that the open exit end faces generally radially outwardly from the drum axis; that is, so that the chamber opens towards, and is coaxial with, the drum.\nWhen the coating material or lacquer flows out of the nozzles, it forms", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

After nearly twenty years of making theatre\\, that reading began to feel like a long-lost piece of family history\\, a ghost-like entity that had been haunting our little theatre for a while. Over the years\\, we thought\\, maybe\\, we’d finally put it down forever. We’d moved\\, sold our theatre\\, forgotten all about it and\\, by the end of 2000 the cast was all either dead or in different places or had moved on.\\nWe went into MIRROR, MIRROR not sure what to think of it or where it was going\\, yet we had a script\\, we were excited that we could finally make this piece of theatrical history\\, and it was our chance to write about the history of the making and performing of MIRROR, MIRROR \\nIn February 2011\\, The American Historical Museum (OHSU) came calling\\, asking to collaborate on an exhibition and theatre piece that would be about this and our previous show\\, which would also be called MIRROR, MIRROR. The project would require our complete and uncensored collaboration\\", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

This heatsink fan may typically be a fan blade assembly that includes a fan blade and a heat conducting fan bracket connected to the fan blade. The fan blade has a plurality of blades to dissipate heat. According to a prior art, the blades of the fan blade must be spaced apart from each other by a uniform distance to increase the heat dissipation rate. However, in practical application, the arrangement of the blades may not be uniform.

The rapid growth of the Internet and the increase in the number of applications available to the Internet led to an increase in the need for better means of maintaining and retrieving information to clients using the Internet. Thus, the first generation of commercial Web servers were used to provide static HTML documents. The Web server was implemented as an “appliance” that was typically configured by a Web master using standard HTML (Hyper-Text Mark-up Language) with a “dumb” server that simply forwarded incoming requests onto a database to retrieve the data and returned the data to the requesting clients. Such static HTML web server appliances, which were not application-neutral, were difficult to administer and did not use a database for storage of the data. In many cases such static HTML appliances were even provided by their owners on “coffee tables” on top of desktops, or in closets of offices, or on laptops, with little security or even the ability to access the data.\nThe Internet and related networks (for example, intranets) also developed applications that became widely used. One such application, for example is the browser program commonly used for retrieving and downloading data from the World Wide Web (Web). Browsers generally run on client computers and have access to a database of documents or files that are stored or maintained by another server. Browsers operate by using an associated client program to accept commands from a user and direct data requests to the appropriate server. Browsers are also designed to support various file or document accessing schemes in the form of plug-ins and other modules.\nOne of the common limitations associated with conventional browser programs is the lack of access to the data stored or maintained in such databases outside the browser program. In order to do so, additional application programs are required as well as a communication interface either between the browser program and external application program or between the browser program and the additional application program.

A sample is then taken in a sampling chamber of a detector located downstream from the injection point. From the sampling chamber the test gas is conveyed to a detector designed to record either the quantity of test gas, or alternatively its chemical composition.\nThe detection method using monitors enables a continuous acquisition of data, the so-called \"on-line\" monitoring. The detectors of these monitors include a reference filter in case of toxic gases. The test gas passes the filter, but the chemical compound does not, and a first electronic circuit is activated which leads to a warning and/or a shutting-off of the monitors.\nTo date the problem of detecting CVCs does not appear to be solved satisfactorily. Indeed, the first problem relates to the detection of CVCs that are present in concentrations of 10 ppm or below.\nThe second problem relates to the fact that the presence of CVCs with a high concentration of pollutants is usually accompanied by the presence of other CVCs with lower concentrations of pollutants in the same volume of air.\nTo date the sensors are not perfect, and the measurement of the test gas concentration does not always enable the detection of CVCs with concentrations of 10 ppm or below.\nIn fact, by way of example, a mixture of chemical compounds that can be toxic can include ammonia, methyl chloride, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, or aldehydes containing a methylene-aliphatic chain.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Field of the Invention\nThe present invention relates to a method for fabricating a semiconductor. More specifically, the present invention relates to an improved process for reducing the size of a photoresist pattern during lithographic processing.\n2. Description of Prior Art\nConventional methods used to form small features on silicon oxide layers include patterning such that a single-layer photoresist is formed or an organic or an inorganic antireflective coating with a high index of refraction (such as titanium dioxide) is used in conjunction with a patterning process. The purpose of the antireflective coating is to reduce light reflected from the substrate back into an upper layer of photoresist. In both case, the size of the photoresist pattern that remains following the removal of the resist film and etching of the underlying oxide is typically larger than the size of the design (e.g. line spaces) in the oxide layer to be patterned.\nIn the prior art, an antireflective coating is typically spin-coated or deposited on a substrate as a thin layer. The coating is then anisotropicly etched in the direction of the thickness (thickness-wise) to improve the depth of focus during exposure-step in lithographic processing. In general, the minimum feature size of a transferred pattern that can be formed with a given thickness of antireflective coatings are much larger than the minimum feature size transferable through conventional masks. The larger the thickness of the antireflective coating, the larger features can be transferred. This phenomenon has been referred to as the edge effect or sidewall undercutting, and has a greater adverse affect in more stringent lithography requirements due to an increase in photoresist thickness. Furthermore, the increased photoresist thickness limits the number of layers that can be patterned below the thickness level. An increase of photoresist thickness reduces process window.\nIt is therefore an object of this invention to provide a process with a reduced line edge roughness; and thereby reduce the size of the photoresist pattern formed during lithography.\nIt is yet another object of the present invention to provide an antireflective coating layer with a high index layer that reduces the undercutting effect of antireflective coatings.\nIn the formation of a single layer photoresist structure during semiconductor fabrication, a layer of photoresist is deposited over an underlying substrate.

While several recombinant polypeptide compositions can be produced using traditional techniques, new methods of manufacture can be exploited that are more efficient, in terms of the use of materials, time and energy required to obtain a single purified polypeptide. In cases where the protein is being made in order to use, add or modify its physical characteristics, there is often a desire to incorporate new material by covalently joining polypeptides or proteins of interest. For example, it may be desirable to join peptide hormones or growth factors to oligopeptides, such as cell targeting sequences or cell proliferation-inducing sequences, in order to produce a new peptide molecule.\nA method for joining proteins or peptides is cross-linking of the proteins or peptides by formation of an intermolecular link, as for example described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,532,128 and 5,650,333. One of the advantages of cross-linking is the ability to join protein or peptide molecules having reactive free amines to proteins, such as enzymes, by reaction of the amines with free reactive groups on the protein or peptide joined with the other protein or peptide. For example, it is frequently desired to attach cell growth-inducing proteins, such as bFGF, to an enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase. This is done, for example, by conjugation of bFGF to the enzyme's reactive free amino groups, as for example by the method of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,532,128 and 5,650,333.\nHowever, some proteins or peptides, because of their reactive sites, are difficult to crosslink. For example, proteins or peptides which contain lysine and cysteine in their sequence are known to be difficult to crosslink. Many proteins and/or peptides which contain reactive free amino groups, such as lysine or cysteine, are insoluble. This can make it difficult to prepare conjugates for the purpose of attaching protein or peptide molecules to an enzyme, since it is often not possible to prepare or obtain sufficient quantities of insoluble enzymes or peptides for conjugation. Furthermore, many proteins or peptides, including enzymes, would be inactive or denatured during the course of preparing a conjugate, thus reducing the utility", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}

Our first focus will be on the regulatory mechanisms involved in the synthesis of two capsule-type polysaccharides which are specific for different serotypes of H. influenzae. Mutations in capsule genes have been shown to be primarily responsible for alterations in serological specificity, whereas mutations in regulatory genes are involved in switching from synthesizing capsule to synthesizing non-capsular exopolysaccharides. The capsule genes have been cloned and shown to be physically linked and possibly regulated in two ways. A regulatory gene, crtE, is required in a complex with a small noncoding segment of DNA (the crtR gene), suggesting that there may be a gene-interference mechanism of regulation involving crtE and crtR. Additionally, the crtE genes (and possibly the crtR) have been shown to be closely associated with at least one capsule gene (crtD). However, it remains to be established whether any other regulatory genes exist and whether capsule/crt genes are actually co-regulated. We propose to investigate this second question by sequencing the crtS and crtP genes, which in other organisms are known to be involved in gene-interference (as sigma factors or their cognate RNA polymerase promoters). In order to understand the complex molecular mechanism(s) involved in regulating capsule synthesis, we plan to continue the isolation and characterization of regulatory genes involved in capsule synthesis.", "ifPrivacy": "no", "ifHarmful": "no", "ifMisinformation": "no"}
